YgqexscIgNoMBAO__J97zA,"With the fierce competition in the valley between cake, pie, and confection makers, this little sweet treat stands out with its creative concoctions.  There is a reason why this bakery has been Phoenix's top for 14 years!Below are a few of the delectable delights that graced my tastebuds on a recent visit, and it may shed light on why more than 100 of Arizona's top restaurants have featured Honeymoon's desserts on their menus.Maple buttermilk pie with linzer leaf cookieApple streusel pie with dried cranberries and toasted walnuts with orange zestSweet potatoes pecan pieCoconut custard piePistachio pagliacci nut cake soaked in coffee syrup finished with genache and butterI am just ""over the moon"" about the inventive flavor combinations, not to mention their artful cakes for any occasion.Definitely on my hit list for cakes, pies, and confections."
iELA6eREUgDVQrtLgYmS6Q,"If you've seen one you've seen them all. Here is another do it yourself yogurt station. Grand Opening was Yesterday July 21st, spend $10 and get a Free T-shirt while supplies last! They had a ton of toppings to choose from ,some I've not seen done yet like those pink and white sprinkled animal cookies, vanilla wafers and ginger snaps to name a few, Yum!I liked it! I got pistachio and tart strawberry, no toppings. The pistachio was one of the best pistachio yogurts I've had.When I'm in this area Yogurtland will be my go to place."
iDoigI3605ixHl_qHly3Tg,"Probably just north of 3 stars, but rounded up for the excellent service.  We got here a bit early for an 8 o clock reservation and decided to hit the bar area.  Be warned, it's not a huge bar area- only 3 tables or so and maybe 10 stools at the bar.  The wait staff there was excellent.  I ordered a pretty simple Hendrick's & Tonic (any place that carries Hendrick's is alright with me), but my friend ordered a specialized drink of 1 part Hendrick's & 2 part Ketel one, shaken, no garnish, with half poured and the other half chilled in a shot glass sitting in a tumbler of ice water.  SHEESH, talk about high maintenance, but they gladly made it and made it to a T.  The steaks themselves were ok.  For the price you pay (~$40 for my bone-in ribeye), you can get a better steak just down the street at Donovan's.  Also, they don't serve any complimentary sides or anything with the steak, unless you order them.  It's just the steak on a plate of sizzling butter.  Quite gluttonous.  I did save a little room for dessert.  I split a flourless chocolate cake with a hint of espresso and a strawberry drizzle.  It was absolutely awesome, and probably the best part of the meal, which, for a steakhouse, probably isn't a rousing endorsement."
lVkDZZ8sTafPlq7f1i5row,"This cafe is 100% vegetarian, with the vegan option available on every menu item.  From past experiences with veggie restaurants in Phoenix, this kind of classification would probably make me less eager to try the place......  which is why I'm happy that the chef/owner instead chose to focus on the fact that they use fresh, local, and organic ingredients -- vegetarianism is more of an afterthought.  So we decided to try it yesterday for lunch.To start, Pomegranate offers a wonderful selection of teas, coffees, and various juice/smoothie options.  I wanted something cool and caffeinated, so I ordered the toddy, which features my favorite local roaster's beans -- Cartel.  My wife order a peach iced tea.  Very good, but if memory serves correctly, you won't find any drink options for less than $2.00 or so.Then onto the main course.  I ordered the veggie burger, which is made from a sprouted tofu, served on a sprouted spelt bun, and garnished with cheddar cheese (or vegan cheese if you prefer), avocado, tomato, and a little tiny dollop of miso mayonnaise.  It also comes with a catch-all selection of sides: salad, tortilla chips, fruit slices, and a pickle.  $10 or so.....Here's my take on the burger:The spelt bun was better than any other spelt bun/bread that I've ever had before.  This was perhaps the second most notable part of this burger.  The most notable was the patty itself, which had a nice mellow nutty flavor -- not trying too hard to be be fake beef and not overpowering in soy flavor.  It was actually one of my favorite veggie burgers ever.  But here's my beef with the preparation: too skimpy on the rich, fatty stuff.  There was a very thin slice of cheese and almost nothing of the single condiment provided, which the menu told me was a miso mayo.  Thanks to the avocado, it was still a little rich, but not the kind of juicy decadence that I've always felt characterizes a great burger.  And seriously, I would have liked to have tasted the miso mayonnaise, but instead added my salad dressing to the burger to make it less dry, and this basically obscured whatever taste the mayo may have offered.The salad was just fine, garnished with what seemed like a raw berry dressing of some sort.  I had no idea that the white stuff in the plastic cup was also for the salad (apparently a living caesar dressing), until the meal was almost over.  I thought it was my mayonnaise for the burger.  Next time, I'll try to get it right and see how the salad tastes with both dressings.We also tried the hummus, mainly because it's the perfect baby-appropriate snack for my son to sling all over the restaurant (the remarkably polite staff was also quite pleasant about bringing in a messy toddler, by the way, which is a plus).  The hummus was actually quite tasty, but somehow not in a ""traditional"" way.  It seemed a little crisper and fresher than most hummus I've had, which was a nice complement to the fresh veggies served with it.  My only additional request for the hummus is that perhaps the restaurant could throw in a few tortilla chips as well?My wife tried the vegan BLT, made with a tempeh-based bacon.  It must have been tasty, because this is one of the first times I've missed my opportunity to try a bite of her dish.  She literally devoured it and then criticized me for nitpicking at the veggie burger's preparation.  I'm pretty sure she'd give this place a 5-star rating, and she may convince me to do the same on our return visit with the in-laws, who have been looking for a place like this.Oh, one final note.  I spoke with the chef/owner after our meal, to offer our compliments and inquire about the cuisine and the marketplace, etc.  She mentioned something that should be readily apparent to most foodies, which is that the key to providing tasty veggie options is to go with a macrobiotic whole food focus -- this approach de-emphasizes the constraints and instead focuses on building a good meal from quality ingredients.  Well done, chef."
Xo9Im4LmIhQrzJcO4R3ZbA,"After reading all of the reviews on Yelp on how amazingly delicious this place was, I decided to try it.  First of all, it was good...but not to the point that every one else is making it seem here. I think with all of the hype, I was expecting little pieces of heaven in every bite! I ordered the bean and cheese chimi enchilada style. I can say that the enchilada sauce was really yummy! I wish i could have finished it all but it was HUGE!! it is a good lunch spot but definitely order ahead because the wait is pretty long. If it is convenient I would probably come again but wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."
x-lEn6WxwqSNrdYdgjRsyw,"Meh....I mean, everybody (from work to here) tells me that Dillys Deli is awesome.  So, maybe I went there with my expectations a little high...But all i got was leaving the place smelling like a Dilly and feeling a little underwhelmed.I got the vegetarian sandwich, which the cashier told me that the mushrooms were grilled.  (Negative...not cooked at all) It was alright, nothing to write home about. The pasta salad was just, well, pasta salad.  But my cookie was really yummy.So, my review is...meh...."
YKOvlBNkF4KpUP9q7x862w,"There's a lot to love about The Mission.  The experience comes so close to 5-star that it makes me want to nit-pick about all the tiny things that fall juuuust short so they can fix them for my next visit!The Bar: What a lovely, refreshing Basil margarita!  It was just sweet enough without being syrupy.  But bartender, why is getting a recommendation out of you like pulling teeth?The Food: Excellent table-side guacamole; it lived up to the very high expectations set by all the other reviewers.  My dinner partner's Hangar Steak was very juicy for such a thin cut and the dressing from the tomatillo salad give the whole dish a tangy, acidic bite.  My Chorizo Porchetta was very unique and flavorful, but a little more sauce would've saved it from being slightly dry.  I love though how the star of the entrees really is the meat here, the portions were generous and the sides were an accompaniment, not a competitor.***Almost forgot about the pumpkin bread pudding we shared!  He loved the scotch-carmel sauce which I thought was too sweet.  I loved the moist, fragrant bread which he thought was missing pumpkin-y spice.  To each their own!The Atmosphere:  It's a gothic romance come to life with beautiful dark metal chandeliers, warm, glowing salt bricks, and dim lighting.  I just wish the table of 6 old men talking golf wasn't sooo close.  A little more room between tables would complete the intimate decor.The Service:  I have no complaints here!  Our server was excellent and never overwhelming, the lady who made our guac was all charm, and kudos to the chef who sent us complimentary street corn (yummy by the way).  A note on the street corn: I felt like this was a dish that would've won the Top Chef competition where they had to re-invent convenience store food.  The grilled, slightly salty & crunchy corn topped with creamy spicy cheese sauce beats any AM-PM nachos I've ever had! :)Lots of wonderful food still to try here.  I will be back very soon for brunch with mom!"
tpIU_ZvIfCfCp36IgghlHQ,"I see that the general consensus on the board is that the food is fast, fresh and simple. It sure is. I mean, not a French fry in sight. Strangely, for a place called ""Zoe's"" that wants to peddle kabobs and pita there isn't a tub of hummus or tzatziki in the building, and the plate was a bit dry without them. Ever hear of Maddox? His piece on Crappy Children's Artwork was likely inspired by the decor. Yiiiiich!!!"
YeDYa6tYL16CyqYvUVOtLw,"My buddies and I decided to hit up the west side last night and visited Margaritaville.  It was one of the most fun nights out that I have had in quite some time.We got there and lucked out and were able to get a table in the bar area that was in a prime location with views of everything going on.  From there on, the night just kept getting better and better.I'll start with the food.  Everything that we ordered (peel n' eat shrimp, tortilla soup, jambalaya, fish tacos, and the ""cheeseburger in paradise"") were excellent.  Our server was one of the friendliest, coolest girls that we have ever met, and made sure that there was never an empty bottle of beer on our table.As for the atmosphere, this was a tale of two worlds.  As the night began for us (right around 8:00), it seemed like the complete opposite of a night out in the Scottsdale area.  There were actually more girls in the place out and about and having fun than there were guys.  Plenty of cute girls (not a single one fitting the ""Scottsdale"" mold) from all walks of life outnumbered the guys by a 3:1 ratio.  I'm so used to heading out to places where it is just a sausage-fest with all the guys there that I almost didn't know what to do with myself.  And the dudes that were there were normal as well, very casually dressed and just there having a good time with the group of people they came with.  Plus people weren't there trying to pick up on folks and act all cool, but rather there just to enjoy a night out.  Then, almost as the clock struck midnight, things changed.  Suddenly it seemed that the place filled up with the ""Scottsdale crowd,"" meaning girls all done up and dudes that looked (and acted) like complete douche bags.  It turned into a sausage fest full of people normally found on the other side of town.  After viewing ridiculous and immature behavior by the new crowd, we settled up and left.The band that performed there this night was AMAZING.  They started at 10:00pm and played covers of popular songs from many genres of music.  There was a small area down by the stage for dancing, and as the night went on more and more people were out there dancing and having a good time.I definitely plan to make this a regular occurrence on Friday nights.  The drive out from where I live in Tempe was well worth it.  I'll just make sure to leave before midnight next time."
ABrSt3fsirLrUYNVrD3fbQ,"went for an early dinner with my honey on saturday.  we normally don't order apps but we we didn't have lunch so we needed something to get us through. we went with the hummus and pita bread and it was so fresh and yummy! server said that it's homemade in house. For my entree I ordered the salmon with mixed veggies and the hubster ordered the crispy chicken and subbed the creamed corn with mashed potatoes, he loved his side of asparagus... smokey flavor.  our server did provide us a lit sample of the creamed corn because he raved how delicious it is. yes the creamed corn was very rich and in my opinion not worth the calories unless you've been good all day.  we both ordered red cabs and we skipped dessert since we were nice and full. enjoyed our meals and the friendly service."
NYIyTj2AZJpAo7XIM-Z7lw,They stay busy.  It is nice if you can sit outside on the water.  The service is fast and efficient and the prices are great.  I really enjoy the cocktails and the charro beans.  Mmmmm...
ycBa5cnSa6hgdB7rb9rdiw,"This place is amazing. I'm a frequent Total & More visitor, always walking up and down the aisles, picking up and putting down 6-packs in search for a favorite to enjoy that evening, or pondering what the new brew will taste like. The prices are unbeatable and by far beat out those of BevMo and the surrounding grocery stores. Nice staff too!"
1Duul3qCnLrNak1Np-iHfw,"My wife and I own Hawaiian Experience Spa in the same center as this Pita Jungle and have found this to be a life saver. We try to eat healthy even when working long hours and Pita Jungle is where we go. Today we had lunch and dinner there! The service is great and everything we have had has been excellent. Today we had the Chipolte Chicken Lavosh Pizza. For $9.49 it was enough for us both.We also order from Pita Jungle at the spa for our date night treatments which include dinner. We try to get only the best for our clients and Pita Jungle is our #1 choice."
Ez2MFsVT5lJZ05yvK_0AXQ,"Last year, my friend took me to all her favorite places in Phoenix and the surrounding area. One of her favorites is Pita Jungle.I had this gigantic ""burrito"" called the Medchilada which was more like a burrito wrapped in lavash and covered with cheese and tomato slices. While the cheese and tomatoes were fine, I realized belatedly I don't enjoy lavash. After a while, I was excavating the thing for chicken. I like black beans better than pinto but they were serving the medchilada with pinto beans. The side of brown rice was over cooked and flavorless. I have to say they did make pretty good humus! I liked the roasted red pepper one and the jalepeno one topped with pico de gallo. The regular hummus needed some more olive oil and perhaps flavor (it was better two days later after the flavors had melded together).Service was pretty slow but we weren't in a big rush."
zonV2F6YNVn2_sI5dK82eg,"My co-worker and I went to Pita Shack for lunch today for the first time. I will have to say the food and services was over the top great. We walked up to the counter and was greated with a great big smile. We told the gentlemen that it was our first time there. He took the time to explain the menu and even gave us a lesson on how to pronounce dishes...I did a great job but my co-worker not so much.  The food is fresh not frozen and made to order.  I had the Chicken Shawerma sandwich and it was very very tasty. My co-worker had the greek salad and she ate every bite. I highly recommend this establishment. I will be returning for sure!"
QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA,"Condor's Piece of Daily Advice:  If a hot, Low Rider bikini model tosses a vodka martini in your face and walks out leaving the tab, there is no better place to be than the Capital Grille at the Biltmore Fashion Park. The bartender was quick with a linen napkin to wipe my face and refreshed the Campari and Coke I had begun. My depression was short and my solace began with the Bar Menu Lamb, a dozen fresh oysters with a hint of vinegar, and a native of San Diego who works as a corporate jet stewardess named Linda. I'll be back to the Capital Grille as soon as I return from San Diego!"
Oj79-vTnjQk_jLr6oNbT0Q,"We stayed at the Westin Kierland and went over to Chloe's Corner for breakfast one day.  What a great little spot!  Independently owned, this place has all the character and atmosphere of a sandwich shop in NY or San Francisco.  They have counter seating at the long butcher block counter, lots of indoor tables and a few tables outside as well.  Coffee, sandwiches, snacks, beer, salads, etc.  Perfect spot for breakfast, lunch or take-out.  Highly recommended."
9ziO3NpoNTKHvIKCBFB_fQ,"I went here with a party of 4 on Saturday night and it was surprisingly dead.  Not that that's a bad thing because I don't like crowds.  The place is pretty sheik but you still feel like you're in a hotel.  Service was fast and friendly but I think it was our waiter's first night or something.  He was very awkward but it was ok.I was pissed we couldn't get the happy hour menu/prices in the main dining room.  I know it is common practice for crowded places full of douchebags, but the bar and the main dining room were pretty empty so wtf?I'm a vodka guy and their vodka menu is pretty neat.  They have 8 or 9 unique vodkas from around the US and clearly list their name, where they are from and the price.  What I didn't like was their martinis.  Pretty much the worst I've ever had anywhere.  Tiny pours and full of ice chips.  It was like a vodka slushy (oh snap I think I just invented something!!!).Here is a rundown of the food:* bread to start - excellent...love the lightly buttered and salted top* tomato and mozzarella salad - excellent - one of the best i've ever had.  great dressing and ample balls of fresh mozzarella.* pretzel fondue - the pretzels were excellent but the fondue and mustard were no bueno.  the fondu was gritty and the mustard lacked the kick that I love on pretzels.* burger - pretty solid but nothing special* mac n' cheese with Shriner's sausage - very unique and very tasty.  it was worth having once but I wouldn't get it again.* tater tots - perfectly cooked.  salty/crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside.  The only thing that would have made these better is some type of aioli or other special dipping sauce other than ketchup.The main dishes of the other people in my party looked excellent.  I should have been more adventurous and gone with something more than a standard burger.  Maybe next time. I was going to give this place 3 stars but I just can't.  They try to think out of the box to create dishes that are unique, have fresh ingredients, and have a local twist.  I will return."
Q0AADLgsYi1sFDk8jtMYUw,"Been to Steve's a few times.  Time for a review.  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)+ Good ambiance.  Low lighting and sweet music.  I really enjoy studying here.+ Slightly above average coffee.  I've had better, but Steve's still has really good drinks.+ Awesome prices.  I'm in college and I really like saving my money.-/+ Customer service is alright.  One time I was there only one barista working.  He was obviously a high school student and had other important things going on.  Two of his friends came in and chatted him up at the counter... and they weren't quiet.  Then, he left the counter, with no one else there, to go outside for a smoke and talk with his little friends.  Nothing happened in result, but I thought it was rude."
hfl62LX14YqNpG0g0Tj6_Q,"Consider this 3.5 stars. So here's the deal.  The service is great, the atmosphere is nice inside and out and the food is good.  The prices?  Not so great for good food.The sides were actually better than the main dish which is where they fall from 4 stars, especially considering that entrees are $20-25 bucks.I had a chicken breast that was panko breaded, smothered in tomatillo & cream sauce, topped with bacon, goat cheese, pico de gallo (fresh onion, tomato, cilantro, etc) and crispy tortilla strips.  Frankly I don't think I ever tasted the chicken.  Or the bacon.  Or the goat cheese.  Those are the things I was looking forward to.  That's what sold me on the dish.  But they were lost in the tomatillo, the cream, the salsa, the tortilla strips...this dish tried to do too much and suffered for it. This chicken was a jack-of-all-trades, master of none.The sides-cornbread casserole and spicy mashed potatoes-were very good.The bottom line?  Good but not great and if I'm paying $21 for a chicken breast I should be wowed."
47A3pWsdYNhFFy9gUEVcYQ,"Freshest, tastiest, Vietnameesiest food around mesa! :)I started going there while attending MCC and got hooked. No other Vietnamese joint has tasted as good since. The staff is always courteous and provides good service. The prices are just a nice bonus. Note that this a pleasant, family run dining place, not an upscale restaurant to go for a date or celebrate an event.Try the Pho (noodle soups), Lemongrass chicken, Mongolian beef and the fresh rolls. Don't forget to top it off with some tapioca drink.Once you're hooked, they do take out (call in the order and pick up in 10 minutes). Have fun! :)"
KTF-E3NfkJy2wiwcgOPyVQ,"Okay, I could probably live without Asian food.  I like Chinese and Thai on occasion, especially if it's cold out.  The rest of it I wouldn't miss.  Sorry, Mexico is my true love.  But I have to say, I love Tottie's, if for no other reason than the Green Curry.  It is easily one of my favorite dishes right now.I've tried both the lemon and tangerine chicken (apparently I could not live without citrus), and while good, they cannot compete with the green curry.  Generally I would prefer Chinese to Thai, or so I thought.  I know, it's like comparing apples to oranges.  I also really like the Tottie rolls.  The spring rolls taught me I'm not a fan of rice paper, but I loved the peanut sauce.  Anything dipped in that peanut sauce would be good!Given its location,  I was pleasantly surprised that Tottie's is actually quite nice inside, although we usually get take-out.  In fact, today is quite chilly.  I think that curry is calling me."
rr13jM6SUmfPPPGHHMHCgQ,"I'm going to update my review for Mido because, well, they deserve an extra star.I took my neighbors to dinner here last Friday night as a thank you for watching my dog while I was in Las Vegas for a week. The service was excellent.  We never waited for a refill.  We were brought the check as soon as we needed it.  And, the server put up with a lot of interesting conversation whenever he happened upon it (and laughed with us).The value was phenomenal.  Where else can four adults and two children start with miso soup and crab salad, eat a gorgeous platter of sashimi, a tempura appetizer, sushi until they are filled and a scoop of ice cream PLUS have sodas and wine for $121 pre tip?My only suggestion to AYCE newbies is to order the more expensive rolls first.  We just put all our rolls on the first sheet and we got the cheaper rolls like California roll and spicy tuna out first.  Then after a good amount of time, they brought the smaller, more expensive Pancho topped with spicy tuna and the soft shell crab rolls.  It is not a big deal if you have an unlimited appetite, but you might as well get the more pricey rolls with AYCE."
flUKBy7WHqYdfOrwU1A2SA,"One Liner: Some of the best TacosFood: (scale of 0-4) 3.2This hole in the wall is apparently famous for the green tamales. Personally, I loved the tacos. (pork mexican tacos especially). The salsa was awesome as well. I could never have enough of it. It's good that we had to pay a small amount for it.

yc5AH9H71xJidA_J2mChLA,"If you're in the neighborhood, it's not full of skivers having a session. Service was friendly and ample. Food was good. Exactly the pub we needed to find. A chat with a local Barney, the jig my daughter ripped into was heart felt, live music, and a boxty that tastes like my dad made it."
BojnLUPz5IzZKyQocGc7uw,"In search of buffet food that was neither Chinese or Sizzler, we found Cubano.  Walking in, it seems a bit confusing but the sweet hostess/waitress was very helpful in explaining things.  I really liked that you could just start digging into the buffet without waiting for a ticket or standing in line and paying.  So we attacked the buffet looking to try a little of everything.The item that stands out the most to me was the Yucca Root.  While it wasn't the best tasting thing on the tray, it was the most surprising thing.  I did not think it would be nearly as good as it was but it was amazing.  I even had a second helping.  I am a big pork fan and theirs was excellent.  The beef and chicken dishes were great too.  I had a bowl of the traditional Cuban soup (whatever it was called) and loved it.  Great food.The dessert tray didn't look that great so we decided to try the ""Best Flan' as voted by PHX New Times.""  I am not a flan fan, at all, but we were feeling adventurous so we gave it a shot.  It was pretty good.  I'm not sure if it was great...the texture is too much for me...but I enjoyed the taste of it.  If you like flan, give it a try, I guess.The place is a bit dingy and feels like an abandoned ""Mariscos""-type place.  They did have baseball on so I couldn't complain about the entertainment.  The waitress was good but I can see her being overwhelmed if the place was packed.  I will be back, without a doubt.  It is a very short walk from the LRT station at Camelback and 19th so that is a big plus as well.  The variety and price make this a great place to hit up when you want some savory food but aren't sure exactly what you want."
S8O3BoCDEK-te8U-0IvZog,"Take a minute to check out the wine in the cellar. Chef D. - awesome food. That tiramisu is pure heaven - and that Zoran guy, i wonder what you were waiting for - finally we have great restaurant and bar to spend some good time in. This bar offers refreshing happy hour meny to break that customary burger mold. Well, the sliders are there, but they are awesome."
DlCtdbceo4YNSI53cCL2lg,"I've only been here twice, after the annual City of Phoenix Bicycle Summit, which happens @ Burton Barr Public Library.  I enjoy the size of the place, and the eclectic decor.  The service was ok.  The food was fine.  The first year we ate there after the summit, I was upset by the lack of bicycle parking.  I ended up locking my bike to a pipe behind the restaurant and worrying the whole time. This year, my friend Joseph had a bicycle rack in his truck.  It was a special bike rack that the city offered to local businesses.  He pulled it out of his truck and put it in front of the restaurant.  We locked up and went in to eat.  When we finished, we returned to find that a couple of bikes who were not in our party had locked up to the rack.We found the manager of the restaurant, and he and Joseph worked out the details for maintaining the safety of the rack and returning it to its rightful owner.  As we unlocked our bikes, a party of 10-12 bicyclists from the neighborhood pulled in and waited for us to vacate the rack.  Bicycle racks bring business, yo!"
peA3F-PnIfijYr8HuG-A-Q,"This place definitely has an upscale loungy feel to it. The only way I found out about it is because I work right in that area. I can see how it would be a nice change of pace from the typical clubs around the valley. It would be a good place to start the evening and maybe impress some people visiting from out of town. Think of a place you would see in L.A. or Chicago. I have been to places like this in each of these cities, dark, swanky, cool, hip. My secret hint for this place is that you can see certain Suns players come in late at night to hang out."
ABrSt3fsirLrUYNVrD3fbQ,My friend and I have a list of places we want to try and this was on it. We went on a Saturday and had no problem being seated. Our server was great. He helped us with recommendations since it was our first time there. We started off with the Snoqualmie Riesling and it was delish. We then split a salad and a sandwich. The salad was roasted beet and the sandwich was the kobe burger and fries. Both were good and cooked to our specs. I would go again and try some other things on the menu.
AuGGWt7dV11fRBl_LPQGwg,"I am a BIG chocolate lover! Who isn't? If you like candy this is a good place to start and visit while visiting the Glendale area.The store itself is well stocked and full of all types of wonderful treats. Most of it is purchased by the pound, but some of it is individually priced, depending on what you buy determines the price.Pretzel rod dipped in white chocolate with sprinkles (2 for $1.00) not bad!The staff leaves a lot to desire for the person coming in wanting a tour which is available daily at 10:00 and 1:00.Even though the tour is about 20-25 minutes long, you walk around the wall looking out on to the floor at a lot of machines. Out of 3 visits here, I have only had the opportunity to see 1 machine working. Most of the tour discusses the various candies and how they are made through the machines.One time I am going to catch them actually making something and than I will come back and re-rate this one :)"
V1nEpIRmEa1768oj_tuxeQ,"Cibo is a really adorable place, but I can't say that I think it is extraordinary.  The atmosphere and ambiance is totally five star, but too much goes wrong after that to give it an overall five star.  Food stuff:  I've been twice and both times I liked it, but it wasn't love.  We got the bruscetta plate and I wasn't really thrilled.  The traditional tomato one was the most solid choice, the bean one was strange and soggy and I don't eat pig so I can't comment on the third one (though everyone else seemed to enjoy it). The pizzas are pretty decent except that they lay out the toppings in a weird way, for example, if you order the vegetarian rosa pizza, if you like zucchini, it is all chopped up on two slices and so on.  It doesn't really make sense to top a pizza in such a way, to me.  I prefer draft beer over bottled beer, and all they offer is bottled.  I did enjoy a couple glasses of the Rossi Cabernet Sauvignon which was a solid wine choice.Service:  The host/ess was a pleasant person, and the time quoted was less than we actually had to wait so that rocked.  While waiting, we attempted to get a drink.  The bartender was cool about getting our drinks in a timely manner despite the fact that it was busy.  Our actual server was super attentive at first and then lost for a good chunk of time as well.  Too hit or miss.  Cibo is an adorable spot with awesome ambiance but it isn't quite that awesome when it comes to food and service."
yJr24Yy1K6bt2G9fX3_zPA,"I had waited for awhile to try this place, as it's buried in a small little shopping center and couldn't find anyone who wanted to enjoy Cuban food. I first had Cuban food at an awesome little restaurant in DC and it was amazing. This, however, was not that place. The summary? I enjoyed it - it was okay, but will not be going back, especially for the bill I paid. The atmosphere is pretty cute, it's in a little house-like restaurant in a small shopping center tucked away on Camelback. But it's pretty quiet inside, so I'm not sure I would really like that for a date. Also, the bathroom is outside, which is a little strange. I had a glass of Malbec that wasn't all that great, but I'm willing to forgive wine. The other two had cocktails which they really enjoyed - so I think I just ordered poorly.Then we ordered 5 appetizers and two entrees to split between three people as we wanted to try all that we could. We had the plantains (they were good, but not the best I've had), then plantain chips with bean dip which was amazing! That was the best part of the meal. We ordered three more appetizers that I didn't really eat, so I can't judge them. I ordered the chicken with the mango sauce that came with beans and rice. For the price of the meal I was very underwhelmed. It was a really sizeable piece of chicken, but I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce and the beans and rice were just so-so. The service though was awesome though. The waiter was great and answered all of our questions and recommended great appetizers. 4 stars for the service for sure.Again, I don't think I would go back often, but I'm glad I at least tried it out. I'm also really happy that if I want legitimate Cuban food, I'm coming back here."
2FudHUhV9U54dm0S1ePuCw,"Fair Trade Cafe is difficult to find.  I drove from Roosevelt to Portland up 1st Avenue and Central twice before seeing the small sign.  Fair Trade offers free parking in a garage that's accessible from Portland and once you're in the garage itself, it's easy to spot the caf.Once inside, I was receiving flashbacks from my years in Flagstaff.  If the Campus Coffee Bean provided a little more elbow room, if Late for the Train felt a little less corporate, you'd easily wind up with Fair Trade.  To some this may be a mark in the negative column, but I found it extremely compelling.  It made me miss my dreadlocks and Birkenstocks.  The shop was populated with a handful of other patrons, mainly men in business suits sitting in front of Apple laptops and women with patchwork hippie skirts reading books.The cafe provides a small lunch menu, offering croissants, quiches, sandwiches, and soups.  I chose a cup of soup and half sandwich.  Both were excellent and the bread was awesome.  I returned my bag of chips since I knew I wasn't going to eat them, and received a complementary cookie.  The staff was attentive, incredibly sweet, and the espresso was wonderful.If I lived closer, I can imagine spending a significant amount of time here.  I think I've found the quiet, quick, and relaxed little sandwich spot that I've desperately needed for a few months."
rwQIBAM_kHtVl1Ks8Flexw,"My significant other had a $25 off coupon from Restaurant.com LOL. That could sum up the whole trip. I haven't been to many restaurants that participate with restaurant.com that are decent at all. I mean, I wasn't expecting much coming into this place, I shouldn't have expected anything here.I was in the mood for some red meat, and sushi places do actually have decent dishes like teriyaki chicken and stuff like that sometimes. So, I didn't mind checking this place out since I do like a little bit of sushi on the side. The boolgogee, plain, simply plain. There was a salad with the boolgogee, but it too was plain. There wasn't nearly enough meat to warrant a price tag of $8, because the salad and rice probably didn't cost more than $0.50 to make.Oh, the sushi? All of the sushi we happened to get were either super plain or super spicy. By spicy, I mean that there were just too many tastes going on at the same time and it was too overwhelming. I tried a few bites of the 3-4 different rolls we got. After I tried each roll I thought that I liked it but that the taste was too overwhelming for me to want to try another bite. We paid $18 for the food even after the coupon, and I honestly think that even at the price it might be a bit of a rip off considering you can get cheaper, higher quality sushi at Teharu.This place is a rip-off for sushi in my opinion. Its not good enough to warrant the hefty price tag. The sad part is that the interior is very well done, if the food was actually good this place would be extremely interesting."
wftoNIA0Q8nX-Da47psBCA,"Worked a block away so figured I'd walk over and check it out. Test time: Lunch rush - 12pm5 tables being served ranging from 2-4 people each table. Not too busy. You seat yourself so I sat alone at the bar. Owner/host was friendly and took my order immediately. Ordered soup of the day: French Onion (seemed fitting) and 1/2 Turkey Panini ($9 combo), along with a French pink lemonade 'soda' ($4). I sat for what seemed like a good 10 minutes before I even saw my soup, which came out with my sandwich.Soup was large, but sadly was very bland. Almost thought they used mozzarela instead of swiss on top (it seemed too 'rubbery' for Swiss)... when I got a good mouthful I could tell it was Swiss, but it was just a little chunck melted in the middle of the bowl instead of covering it (which is what I'm used to). A little (or a lot) of salt improved the taste of the soup. Panini was good, but nothing super special. I had to dip it in the soup b/c the bread was so... Crunchy (i.e. hard).To go I asked for one chocolate and one almond croissant ($4 each). Almond croissant was chewy (i.e. not fresh). Chocolate croissant was more flakey, so likely was fresher.$22.17 = one person for lunch & dessert. In this economy, I find it frustrating that they trump up the 'French' aspect to justify overcharging you for something you can essentially get at Paradise Bakery for 1/2 the price.I hale from Chicago, land of the best food around. Not 10 minutes from my home in the suburbs was an awesome little French bistro (Cocoa Bean) that made the BEST desserts (almond croissants included) I've ever had. Worth every penny and always fresh. About 30 minutes away from my home was a family-style Greek restaurant (Pomagranate) that made the best French Onion soup I'd ever tasted. All be it my standards perhaps are somewhat high. But if you speak with a strong French accent to me when I walk in the door, my expecation is that you'll make great food because that's what I'm paying for.This is not a place I'll be visiting again or suggesting to anyone else, which is a real pity :("
IQaND6HcN6NdtQ8QysO3Fg,"Service wasnt friendly. Food not that great. They dont have carne asada.No street tacos. They are catering to the more American palate."
GqtMJxq5-7Xp1ZXXmahLaA,"I am at work today, talking to my co-worker, letting her know that I was going to Taco Bell for lunch.  She looked at me disappointed, and said ""I never want to hear that you are gaining weight again...stop eating that!""  She then told me about Sacks....I decided that I would give it a shot. (not that is was any healthier....)I wasn't real impressed with the layout of the place, even where it was located.  It was getting busy when I walked in...and had no idea what to order.  I ended up with the Van Gogh, which was roast beef, dill, alfalfa sprouts, cheese and I subsituted the marble rye for a tomato basil bread.  The girl at the counter was really sweet and helpful at helping me pick out what I wanted.  My sandwich was really good, and it wasn't just a normal sandwich.  I also liked the little cookie that they snuck into my bag.  And the fact that they have Stewart's root beer was a nice bonus.The only thing that I could say that was negative is that I left there still smelling the kitchen on my coat.  And it wasn't pleasant."

Everything was delicious.  We went for dinner so it was 15 and change for adults and our kids were 10 basically.   The sushi bar was awesome. Instead of having a chef put out 5 or so different kinds of typical sushi. There is a chef making sushi to order. the menu to order off of is pretty extensive. My kids and had quite a few crab legs. The crab legs were also not your typical buffet grade.

No sharks just little fish chasing around and trying to eat quickly.I wanted something light so ordered the chicken tostado ala carte with quacamole.  A pleasant surprise with large chunks of hot white chicken, chopped lettuce and just a few beans, tomato and cheese. on a crisp corn tortilla. The quac came on the side so I could add as necessary.The tostada with a glass of Dos Equis came to $11.01 and that included a basket of chips and two sauces.

PdRzCJWP7nPdYoHPdd5SOQ,"My Local First Arizona member review this week is Portland's Restaurant & Bar located at Central &  Portland in downtown Phoenix.I arrived at Portland's a little before the lunch hour to have a sit down with owner Dylan Bethge. Unlike many privately owned downtown restaurants, Portland's exudes an upscale richness rather than downtown funk. Dark woods and deep color schemes invite a feeling that this is a deal-making hangout... a bit like Victor's in the old days of Phoenix. It's classy without being too pretentious and has a comfortable, neighborhood feel.Dylan joined me and we talked a bit. He and his wife Michelle opened the place in 2001. Michelle grew up in the food business and Dylan too has a rich background having been in management with Tarbell's, Starbuck's and Houston's. I started out asking about how the light rail had affected his business since he's located right on Central near one of the stops. He said it was ""pretty ugly"" for a while. However, many of their clients work downtown... lots of politicos, attorneys and such. (My initial thought of this being a ""deal-making place"" turned out spot-on.) In addition to the executive client??le, Portland's has a strong neighborhood following.The menu is pretty down to earth with just the right amount of flair to excite the taste buds. Dylan says their food choices are customer motivated. He and Michelle focus on wowing their clients, not the gourmet food critics. When asked about the chef he told me that he and Michelle take care of the back end. Both are passionate about good food and have the skills to ensure a consistently fine product.I can't forget to mention the bar side of Portland's. Although talked about as a wine bar, they actually have it all including a fine assortment of scotch... the always popular choice of business types. The wine bar is extensive with a variety of solid names and many boutique wines including Joel Gott, A to Z Wineworks  among others.I really like the Bethge's commitment to community. Having grown up in Phoenix, Dylan cares about this town. He and Michelle buy as much of their fare as possible locally. Schreiner's Sausage and Four Peaks Brewery are but a few of their local suppliers. In addition to vendors, they support local artists by rotating a variety of artwork on Portland's walls. Luis Gutierrez's thought provoking work was there on my visit.Dylan and Michelle have a great place... one that makes our downtown better and offers a bit of distinction. Next time you are wondering where to have a fine meal with great ambiance, give Portland's a try. Having tried it once, it will be on your short-list of places to dine when heading downtown for an event or work."
yYbd9P1KmlPSKmQxo68n_g,"I had forgot how long it has been since I have updated a review. Pulled pork piled high on a fresh bun with some good bbq sauce...sounds like a good lunch to me. I have been cutting the amounts of food I eat and opted for the PPS with no sides. There was plenty of meat and bread for a lunch. They have opened the suite behind them to allow for additional seating. To be honest It looks like a kick ass place to have a get together or small party!The staff was great as usual. I appreciate that most of all."

I found a new favorite.(Whitehall Lane Cabernet)He was great company while I waited for my guests to arrive. Thanks PJ~Dinner was Delicious as usual, although I did notice they increased their prices a bit.I ordered Shrimp Cocktail, Ruth's Chop salad, Seared Scallops and the broccoli augratin. (see pics) I really don't care for red meat anymore but their Rib-eye is Delicious if your a steak eater.My guests ordered the filet and crab legs, tomato salad, house salad and a rib-eye and they loved every bite as well.After dinner we relaxed for a bit on their patio complete with fireplace and the most comfy patio chairs I've ever sat in (see pics)I spent nearly a $100 on my dinner alone but it was worth every delectable bite~"
jVgtPnzXvZQOCCIUPEBktA,Stopped in for a late lunch with a friend. The ambiance was good. The restaurant was clean. The service was average if not a bit slow. The food was good/average. There is nothing about the place that makes it stand out good or bad. A nice neighborhood restaurant and retreat from the heat.
luCSjoNQ9q_0QIjKKOy2pQ,"Who would have thunk?!? South Scottsdale has a four peaks-esque brewery. From the moment you walk in you it's as if you're brought into a different city, people are laid back, chill, tables all over the place, there's a bar, and a refrigerated section filled with beers. it's loud, people are hanging out with friends, enjoying beers in different glasses according to how it should be served, and many are playing board games. I felt as though I was in Austin at some bar, found a table plopped myself down and looked at the different brews offered. It seems Papago brewing has 5 brews to their name one of which is the Orange Blossom that my friends is manna. it's a light beer that after first sip, the aftertaste gives you a light hint of orange creamsicle goodness. YUM!! served with an orange slice, the beer tastes good until the last drop. I am a fan of the Peach beer of four peaks but this yelpers is better because the Orange Blossom has the ongoing blossoming of flavor! The food offered is nothing special, it's food to fill your stomach to prevent you from getting too drunk, and something to nosh on while enjoying beers, laughs, conversations, and soaking up the atmosphere. After my tall pint of Orange Blossom, I got myself a pint of another Papago brew - the Elsie (Irish Coffee Cream Stout). I liken this dark beer to black coffee with a hint of sweetness, it's heavy and good. It just sucks that I couldn't finish my whole pint due to being full from our shared plate of pizza bites and chicken quesadilla. And get this, it cost $4.59 per draft. CHEAP! and afterwards my crew and I walked out of the porthole and found ourselves back in South Scottsdale in a strip mall that bears the Papago name."
5_Il_eOuwOMMoiT8jGBxyQ,"That has got to be one of the coolest patios in town for a get together.  I was another of the Yelp group (and friends) in attendance last night for happy hour.  We had a long table reserved for us.  The bartender was also our waiter for the evening.  To my knowledge, with all of us moving around, I don't think he screwed up a single order of food or drink.  The manager, Matt, came by to check on us several times.  I arrived fairly early and before I was tempted to work my way through multiple baskets of the wonderful bread and pesto I ordered a serving of crab cakes.  They were quite good, certainly not enough volume to replace an entree.  I was offered several choices of pizza slices and accepted a bruscetta one which was delicious.  Of the many pizzas ordered I did not hear one person that was less than satisfied.  I do of sort regret not trying the white pizza but I was at that not full but no longer hungry point where I should, but don't always, stop.  We did cause one hiccup in the evening, many of us decided it was time to go at the same time and with all the separate bills to figure out at once it swamped the entire staff to the point a couple of people at the bar complained they couldn't get a drink.  Most of the night we ordered as individuals or pairs as we saw fit so we never overwhelmed the kitchen or the server.  I have yet to figure out why groups of people (non business) that are going to be there for a couple of hours anyway have to all order and get served at the same time.  We must have at least looked like we were well behaved, Matt invited us back."
GAPqG0WNBBidKeZTMpEZ-w,"Quite possibly the coolest place to sit outside and have a cocktail downtown.  I have a friend who lives in Ahwahtukee and we meet here occasionally as it's a nice half-way point.The outside dining area/bar is spacious with a wonderful assortment of comfy places to sit.  The atmosphere is casual and inviting. The staff is friendly and laid back.My favorite cocktail - the Cucumber Martini - YUMMY!"

I must say no Spanish tapas place ever made me feel like Sens did (except the time I drank a pitcher of Sangria)!The Tofu dishes are amazing. How do you learn to love Okra? Get it at Sens. The Hong Kong rice noodles were not what I was expecting so I was a little taken back by them looking like a plateful of water chestnuts.

qB-qsaSnhbHCt18_AN4Quw,"OK, I hate to be negative, but this place is missing its marketing ""sweet spot.""  (Pun intended.)  This place needs to market itself as an after dinner LOUNGE!  The concept is outstanding, but I lose the enthusiasm of booze and ice cream (two of my favorite things!) when I walk in and it feels a bit like Grandma's house.  The ice cream is absolutely outstanding though, really good flavor and texture.  The price is fair.  And the service was good.  I think I was speaking with Lee herself, who seemed a bit shy, but nice.I hope she does well; I'll be eager to follow her success."
Ch_2Ye0w4Q9l3VeVW7VNHA,"I love this place and let me tell you why. Pure and simple I'm a control freak.. I like to control all aspects in my life and when I cant have my way I get a little wigged but quickly get over it. I mean we really all like to have control of our lives, well why not our food as well? This place is awesome for control freaks who don't want to be forced into a pre-determined salad.. you control every aspect.. your greens, toppings, dressings, vinegars, salt, pepper.. its so awesome! On top of the control issue I also like places that are locally owned and have the freshest ingredients.. Market Bistro fills both of those perfectly! MB also plays really cool downbeat music, thats awesome! On my last visit they were even playing Poor Leno by R??yksopp.. I thought I was the only one who listens to them! They also do that song for ""Its so easy a caveman can do it' commercials.If you have control issues or not and want to control what you're eating, MP is the place for you!"
ttLtsY1S2Angj6hvEdzwDQ,"These are the facts of what happened to me after a visit to the Blue Martini.  Am I saying that these guys are crooks?  No.  Maybe it was just a coincidence.  Draw your own conclusion.I left the Blue Martini and forgot to cash out at the bar.  The next day while Blue Martini had my card in there possession, over $3300 worth of fraudulent activity took place.  When all of the dust settled and the bank rejected some of the charges I had lost roughly $2200 out of my account.  Luckily the bank took care of everything for me.I contacted the general manager, John Martin, and he adamantly stood behind his staff and his procedures for absolute security of cards left at the BM.  Yet when I asked for my card at the hostess station the next day, after all of the fraudulent activity had already occurred, the girl just reached under the hostess desk and grabbed a huge binder of lost cards.  It was obviously left unsecured, unlocked and who knows if it had been left unattended.Mr. Martin handled the situation fine and rebuilt some of the confidence I had lost in the place.  I inquired about having a party there for 20-30 people which would be in two weeks.  He said he'd have one of his team contact within two days.  Two days went by and no contact had been made.  After his failure to follow through, I secured another venue.  I contacted Martin a week after my initial inquiry about the party to ask why I hadn't heard back.  He told me he hired a new guys and then he became argumentative (but somewhat still professional) in his email, saying if I such an ""extreme sense of urgency"" I should've called.  I basically told him that I correspond via email so I have a record of how the situation goes.  It's the last time I'll deal with this company.  I will spread the word every chance I get also.Did I ever say they stole money from me? No, nor did i ever accuse them of it.  I informed him of what took place and asked him to look into it.  Did I ever ask for any kind of compensation?  No, I never wanted anything from these people.  I have the email to share with anyone who would like to see them.  This is why I use email and not phone calls John...Too bad, this place is 5 minutes from my house."

EfXg0Bnv4RAbP4xfgxSiiw,"Solid offerings on the menu, with an eye for healthy ingredients and unique flavor, all in clean, tastefully modern environment.  After hearing great things about BB Cafe, I drove over with a friend for a weeknight dinner.  I was impressed to see that BB has a breakfast, a lunch/dinner, and a late night menu, as well as a full coffee bar.  I decided to go conservative and do one of the sandwiches, which came with your choice of a side (I believe the options were barbecue chips, potato salad, or fruit, but I may be off).  After a brief conversation with the waitress regarding her opinion on which sandwich was BB's best, I ended up with a Turkey Bacon Pesto sandwich with a side of potato salad.Sandwich was great.  The turkey bacon pesto comes on ciabatta bread, was big enough to be filling without leaving me stuffed, and had a nice balance of flavor.  For the price, it was unbeaten by anything else in the Tempe crowd of eateries in terms of 'bang for your buck.'  And I think I'd be silly not to mention that the place had a sweet vibe.  It's neat and tidy - and from the counters, to the tables, to the chalkboard-wall menu, to the style of food, has a very hand crafted, modern, and natural feel to it.  I liked it a lot, and will definitely be coming back this weekend for some breakfast."
o1GIYYZJjM6nM03fQs_uEQ,"It seems like a cool idea, and as you park and see this unassuming building and begin the trek down the stairs it seems like it might be a cool night after all. Unfortunately, after that it is just ok. The service was ok, the food, some good, some not so great. I guess it is hard to expect great seafood this far from the ocean, but I have had better here in the valley.On top of that it is underground, so if you are unfortunate enough to go on a day Sally and Bob decide to bring their rug rats, (think acoustics and screaming children) the whole thing just sucks. It is also quite expensive for my taste. $100 for 2 people and no cocktails."

V6BYjHM9SnXscfkln3hCdA,"I yelped this place and ordered what most of the stuff that people had recommended so I was not disappointed with the food, but the service is not good at-all. People are sweet but they do not manage the orders well.I went here for a Saturday brunch with friends. After a short wait of 15 minutes, we were seated on one of the tiny tables. I liked it coz it reminded me of san fran restaurants. We waited for 15 minutes til  some one came to take our order. (It's ok,it was a busy day.) We ordered our stuff with minor changes in the menu offerings. Cappuccino to start with and water on the side. After 30 minutes of waiting, we confirmed if the nice lady had taken our order or if she forgot. She apologized that she had forgotten but our food will be on the way soon.I was really hungry by then, thank goodness the coffee came and gulped it all down real fast, wait, it was not hot enough. But I would not complain cz it was filling at least till the time our food showed up. (Hey!) The changes that we made to the stuff on the menu were not taken care of like no-cheese, rye instead of sourdough etc. (C'mon!!) We told our server and she said we could start eating and she wil bring in another order of  the eggs (no-egg yellows) and extra bread. (Seriously?Whatever!!) I had started eating so by the time the egg-whites omelet came, i was full. I took them to-go.The food was good so I was not angry till we were gonna pay, hence the 20% tip.Learning: The service is not good, food id better than a lot of places in Scotttsdale/Phx area. But if you are looking for a good-food place that does not keep you waiting, this is not what you want to pick."

I am told they no longer have that on tap and wasnt offered a bottle, so I am not sure if they carry it anymore.  :( This makes kiki a sad lady. We were starving so we started with an app. We waited over 20-30 minutes for our app to come out. The place wasnt busy at all and there were multiple waitresses. We actually had forgotten we ordered the app when it did finally come out. It took another 20 minutes for our order to come out. Not sure what was going on there. The food was just as fantastic as always!"
yJMLD-6AggZNdC-GonVBsA,"This may be heresy but I felt like the food was just pretty good.  Certainly the chef is a down to earth , nice host.  The restaurant is small and in a nice location way in Cave Creek.  We drove from Chandler for this meal and had the tasting menu.  Some courses were very good and some fair (especially the Asian fusion stuff - seems to never work for me)  only.  We enjoyed the experience but it wasn't the best ever.  It's worth a try if you are nearby but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
jFfrM1y-L1icUZXjBpxmeg,"I am a hot dog lover. For the past five years I've found no greater joy in Phoenix than hitting up Nogales Dogs for the best meal on the planet. Each evening when the Keyboard City on 20th St. and Indian School closes, the parking lot is converted into a quaint little dining atmosphere. I most enjoy going around six, the sun is setting and the buzz of traffic makes Phoenix seem more alive. This is my own preference and I know many people who hate going at this time because of the loud traffic. The bacon wrapped dogs are made to perfection with your choice of mayo, beans, tomatoes, onions, jalapenos, cheese, mushrooms, and lettuce. And to top it all off you can wash it down with a Mexican Coca Cola, mmm so sugar filled. Don't forget to bring cash and your appetite."
o9nCXNC14VScabiy2bftgw,Meh at best....the beer is cold. The girls are half naked....but the food is uneventfull and the beer expensive. Go here for (1) beer or (2) and to check out the girls that are clad in very little (ASU students)....and then go eat someplace else. Its a great place to visit once in a while...but its just so obviously a place that serves bad food and watered down drinks to lighten your wallet!
UIGFrEcoDsw05I1UOrxdOA,"Cyclo is like the cooler, hip younger sister restaurant of Khai Hoan in Tempe (They are literally sister restaurants, as stated on their menu).  It exudes the exuberance of youth, but doesn't quite capture the authenticity and depth of menu that Khai Hoan does.  The interior is similar to a funky little boba shop, with lots of bright, pop-star colors and design, and those that are unfamiliar with Vietnamese cuisine may find this as a good stepping stone.  The menu is very limited, and portions are smaller than Khai Hoan, albeit more fancifully decorated with flair.  Prices are also higher.  The papaya salad I had was good, and had a good balance of tangy, spicy, and sweet.  My husband's mixed grill entree was decent, but the strips of meat were slightly overcooked so they tasted tough.Justine, the owner, was here and she is charming, vibrant, and always has a funny story to tell.  I do give her props for creating a more welcoming atmosphere for those that are usually afraid to try different foods, but for me, I'll probably head to Khai Hoan for my Vietnamese fix."
yGmdo1ENajB98iryHGoWFw,"Okay, the Time Out Lounge is alright and divey and crawling with scenesters and all, but I have always had fun at Monkey Pants.  They always serve me HUGE shots, so I wind up hammered quicker than normal, and perhaps that colors my estimation of the establishment... but I really like it.  It's kitschy, and I think that's cute.  This place is eclectic.  I'm not totally sure if it is going for being a dive, a sports bar & grill, or a retro punk kind of place, but I kind of like that it has all of the above because it just doesn't seem that pretentious to me. I always appreciate the camp-factor in a bar, and the yule log on the television in the back with the velour-covered parlour furniture is a hoot. I also like that it isn't on the main drag, because the strip-mall setting isolates it a bit from the douchebaggery.  It kind of has to be its own destination.  I usually get good service, and while the music can be hit or miss, I'm drunk quick so it's just funny.  I don't think it's that overpriced, and I really like hanging out here.  Being that I do have to make a twenty-ish minute drive to get here, I like it enough to find it worth coming back to, even though it isn't that local to me. Oh, and I know they do ""Shirtless Shots."" Before you get too excited, just know that you'll take the good with the bad on that one. I have seen my fair share of pasty, sagging flesh at the bar.  And bra staps, too. It's funny... as is the infamous goldfish racing.  Not like I participate or anything."

OFBJtqWGSx6n6CchtVmoRw,"Excellent!  Sometimes a little noisy.  Sometimes a wait. I pretty much always get a lettuce wrap cheeseburger, their bread is too big AND sweet potato fries!  I love how the fries come out in little shopping carts.  It was the first restaurant I had been too after living in NYC that reminded me of NYC!  That was one of reasons we kept going back.  And now they have cupcakes too!  Or just head across the street for gelato!"
t4aP7ksa716XY6S4EsWFqw,"CAUTION: Maui Dog is Highly Addictive.The above statement should be printed on the menu, by the way.My friend has been raving about this place for weeks now...and last night I finally stopped in only to find myself waking up this morning CRAVING it again! Yikes. And it's on my commute home from work. I think I am in trouble...By my friends recommendation, I had the Lava Dog, Shaggy Style. Basically, an all beef hot dog, chili (""lava"") - monterey jack cheese - Maui cole slaw (""shaggy""). The slight sweetness of the bun, bit of salt with the dog and chili topped with the crispness and freshness of the maui slaw creates the perfect balance. Now it's a ""taste explosion"" at a hot dog 'stand'? Better believe it.Next time, I want to try something different...like the Brat dog or Spam slider. They offer unique toppings for all dogs - maui style - chipotle garlic mayo, maui mustard, coconut and pineapple topping to name a few. I am going to have to go for the shaved ice next time too, especially Amy's recommendation of the ""Tiger's Blood""Some inside SCOOP on this place, because I asked the owner John (who's super nice) a million questions. The Chili is Vegetarian. The buns are AMA-ZING and it's his own recipe. The buns are baked fresh locally. The brats are made especially for him as well. He was inspired by a place he visited all of the time in Hawaii - while he was surfing! A good enough reason for us Phoenicians to welcome a little ALOHA in our lives.SOME OTHER THINGS I LIKE?   - They DO take debit cards, it's NOT cash only.    - THEY ARE PET FRIENDLY (Patio, obviously)   - I love the surfboard painted out front, makes for some entertaining photo shoots for kids, pets and hey...even adults!I'm glad to support a locally-owned, unique business that offers a fantastic product. Mahalo!!!"
drqCrnSqtGffJ1z60aWkxg,"For having a ""normal"" experience at one of the other locations, this one was great.  I do believe that the layout of this location is EXCELLENT.  The massive TVs are a HUGE plus.  I was totally diggin' that at my bar seat, the TVs were the PERFECT distance from my eyes where it didn't blind me.  It was awesome!Another thing... GET THE DRUNKEN CLAMS.  I swear, I wanted to drink the broth after I was done.  There were a ton of clams and it was just great.I also got the Gaelic Chicken... OMG. I absolutely hate saying ""OMG"" but OMG.Get it.  If you like chicken, onions, mushrooms, mashed 'taters and an excellent sauce to top it all... GET IT.The waitress was real nice and cute little thing too. Alana... I liked that she put her name on our little drink coasters.  That's how I remember her name."
no_FXjscklz1SEzM_XnVgw,"Petite Maison, you may earn the title of petite in the size of your little Maison but your food earns the title of grande! The appearance of Petite Maison earns a point because it's this adorable little cottage situated in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Old Town. True to its French roots, the stucco exterior is full of greenery and flowers and resembles a cottage straight out of a french children's book. It's just as dainty inside. When you first walk in, it's similar to walking into an enchanted cottage with a bar on the left and intimate dining on the right. The patio is hidden and covered with plants. While petite, it really is the perfect size for the concept. The food is tres bon. I've tried their two specialties: the salmon braconne and the burger Maison. My goal is to try everything on the menu but for now I think I've gotten le creme of the crop in the cuisine department! Normally more of a sandwich girl myself, I heard that the salmon salad was pretty spectacular so I had to give it a go. The reviews don't lie my friends. It's delicious. It's buttery, delectable, refreshing and literally melts in your mouth. The poached salmon is cooked to perfection and I wish I had the entire salad and not just half! However, the burger was just as spectacular as I hoped as well. With the brioche bun and gooey cheese, it also melted in your mouth and the bread was as soft as can be. Next on my list is to try the Croque Monsieur because if it's anything like the food I've already tried, then I know my taste buds are in for a treat! All in all, Petite Maison lends for an adorable experience and I think this would be a good restaurant to go with friends, your Mom or even on a date. Or all of the above! The staff is incredibly friendly and I wish they would place petite maisons all over the valley! We need more french dining like this."
#NAME?,"This place was really nice inside. It was very classy and the waiter was attentive. The food was just whatever. Nothing too great. The sushi was made to order but came in very small portions. Since all I wanted to eat was sushi this made it very difficult and awkward for me. I don't really like buffets ;{That's why I'm trying to be nice about it. It's really unfair for a person who doesn't like buffets to review a buffet. My boyfriend said the food was just okay. Everything was cold. Decent...but cold.They had Mr Pibb though and in my book that earns an automatic star. I don't care what you say. That's a very important thing!"
mUVTlJSil_xyjPD6qMx8UA,"Another day, another Middle Eastern restaurant. Seems to be my m.o. these days. Working late one evening last week, I was driving home, hungry and delirious. I was thinking what was in my fridge...peanut butter and 6 kinds of mustard. Yeah, no. Nothing but something vile could come out of that combination.So I thought of stopping somewhere on the way...and then I remembered Fattoush, a little piece of the Middle East I remember driving past a number of times, smack dab in the middle of Vietexico-ville. Walking inside, I realized immediately in this casual eaterie with the Iraq-map-shaped clock and the Iraq-shaped tricolored poster that this was the third Iraqi-owned restaurant I've been to so far in Phoenix. Who knew there were so many? Not me, anyway. Other paintings depecting Middle Eastern life adorned the walls. Traditional Iraqi music played from the soundsystem.I sat down and noticed a ""Best Of Phoenix"" award poster on the wall. However, this wasn't a ""New Times Best Of Phoenix"" award, which to me after initially giving it much credence when I first moved here means absolutely nothing (""India Delhi Palace the best Indian food in Phoenix""....are you f-ing kidding me?). Fattoush's ""Best of Phoenix"" award was given by the local Valley Arabic newspaper, which I'm going to take a shot in the dark and guess carries just a tad more credibility. But for those folks who do live and die by the New Times' ""Best Of Phoenix"" awards, Fattoush won for ""Best Mediterranean Food, 2005"", so there you go. The Arabic newspaper award was given for Phoenix's ""Best Mixed Kebab"". Best Mixed Kebab? Now that's a random award if I ever heard of one. But hey, you know what, when in Rome, eat their mixed kebabs. So that's what I ordered ($9.25). An order of soup or salad comes along with the entree - and I chose the soup. The soup was a hearty rice and yellow lentil soup, not spicy hot but still flavorful and rich - reminiscent of a kind of  ""daal"" dish my mom would make. In any case, I enjoyed it.My main entree was a hearty platter with rice, pita, humus, baba ghanoush, garlic dip, a pickle slice, and two skewers: one of ground lamb and the other of chicken pieces. I thought the chicken kebab skewer was interesting. It was marinated in a red sauce that I hadn't seen used in any of the other local Middle Eastern restaurants. It was still tasty, though. The lamb kebab was also tasty and juicy - not overly done where it ends up being too dry. As for the other items:Rice: 3 HookahsPita: Standard, not homemade - 2.5 HookahsHumus: 4 HookahsBaba Ghanoush: 4.5 HookahsAll in all, I was really satisfied with my meal and thought it was a great value for the money. I'm glad I finally came in to check this place out. The service was friendly, and it was apparent that this place was popular with local to-go orders, as I saw people coming in time and time again to pick up their dinner for the evening.Will definitely be back. 4 stars."
puFrm8eNizztqaWr_e32pQ,"I was not expecting much from Lemongrass Thai, especially when my friend and I pulled into the sardine-tight parking lot. It looked like the most dingy place in Tempe. Little did I know it would be one of the best lunches I've had without spending a small fortune. In fact, without tip, my entree (with water) was $7.52. I ordered the #7 - with eggplant, green peppers, carrots and tofu (yum!) and nixed the onions. The dish came with a pile of white rice, a small egg roll and a little bit of dipping sauce for the egg roll. It was all VERY GOOD! The atmosphere doesn't amount to much. The service is just okay. The people taking your orders and bringing the food aren't what I'd call ""people pleasers,"" but they're there to make some mean lunch dishes - not schmooze and win you over with charm. But, let's face it, the food spoke for itself. I had every intention of eating only 1/2 and saving the other portion for later. I couldn't stop eating. The flavors were great! And the fare was light enough that I wasn't stuffed and leaving with a bloated tummy. An added touch: A wrapped mint at the end. A sad note: I tried to order the Green Chai Tea. ""No Green Chai Tea!"" I was told. Bummer. I would definitely go back here and recommend it to anyone who likes Thai, especially those who are fortunate enough to live and/or work nearby. Just beware of the parking lot!"
WJ5mq4EiWYAA4Vif0xDfdg,"12/10/09Attended Yelp Office Hour here today.  Had the latte w/ a few chocolate chip cookies that Sarah G. had made.  Lovely space (and delicious latte)!  I'd give 4 stars if the coffee was served at the table, but for now only 3.  I like the nice furniture, both at the dining area and the working lounge.  I hope to be back soon to have another latte (and a pretty one, at that!), catch up on writing Yelp reviews, and just hang out!"
#NAME?,"It's been nearly  9 months  since the wife and myself ate at Quiescence on a Friday evening.It takes an evening to really go through the experience and that's the best way to explain it because objectively this has to add up to more than the sum of it's parts. The grounds are great and a nice transition from the orange vampire lights of Phoenix but it's likely If you ride a bike it's pretty bloody perilous to get your stand down,or to wear high heels ( Hey those Harley guys are hiding something;) ) I have a rural background, and the outside tier of Quiessence , the one just in the main entrance,really didn't hack it in terms of ambiance, it's like sitting in my UK farmhouse at night :  ( Ok that may be exactly the point they are going for but I kinda feel that we missed out by not being in the main room)  So what of the food?  I have to concur with many that have said that the natural ingredients, the  meats, cheeses , presentation and knowledge of the staff are excellent though  possibly a tad presumptive re what my next question would have been.  We cook a  lot at home but it's not possible for me to know every herb that goes on a plate I like to learn but preempting my ignorance?  The salad was probably the best one I've ever had which when considered next to my chosen second plate of Duo of Housemade ""Boudin Blanc"" Sausage and Slow Roasted Pork Belly with Butternut Squash ""Mash"" should  be a good indicator of how I rank salad in the scheme of things.Their wild foraged mushroom salad  was, well it's 9 months later and I still, recall it fondly.  We'll certainly go back but it's more of an annual event. Quiescence is  like getting your first real watch. It  kicks you off into a search for ever more interesting pieces but you still end up having a soft spot for the original. 4.25 stars if I could rate it like that.Just a little too high on the price for what goes into the main dish. The appetizers, plate one, salad were all worth it in a way that our entrees were not. Given that we'd just had great appetizer, beginning and first plate it was anti-climactic for the entree to be ,you know, just great. (Yeah I know ungrateful , there's people starving in the world ,we were two of them in the interim between plate 1 and 2 :) ) A small  frustration was the water. The mineral water gets up to room temperature between courses and at $9 a bottle ,a mark-up that makes me want to switch to wine next time, the Pillsbury Roan red, and  take a cab."
50hOEQ2OutvIxrMjNml5bA,"Delicious food, great service, loved it! It was served family style so our group of 7 got to sample all kinds of yummy goodness. I brought home a menu so I could accurately describe what we enjoyed.As we were seated, I was fascinated by the art hanging above our table. It had so much texture and color, but I couldn't tell what it was. The restaurant owner, Masoud, explained that it is a Persian rug that took 4 years to make. There were several others around the restaurant that were equally beautiful. Dinner at an art gallery? I love it.Now on to the food. Next time we go, we're ordering:* Maust' Khiar and Maust' Moosier($5.50, $6) yogurt dips w/grilled pita. So creamy and flavorful. I would be content with that as a meal.*Chef's Special - it's $30 and could easily serve 3. It is the combination plate with Barq (filet mignon), juicy chicken filet, and the koobideh (kinda like meatballs), basmati rice and grilled tomatoes.*Dessert! I don't usually like baklava, but this has changed me. It wasn't too sweet or goopy. Lots of flavor. The other ""must repeat"" is their ice cream. It's yellow in color, but pistachio, honey and saffron in flavor. Mmm mmm, good."

They were very friendly and were nice enough to inform us there would be 2 servers since it was Sunday and they like to tagteam if they are slow!"
hyff2JyqQgf85MaJZslHCg,"Late evening on a week night and we were hungry. We phoned around to a few places and decided to come here. It was a short drive from where we were staying but Ztejas has never disappointed before. I used to go in Vegas and loved their Diablo Chicken Pasta. I am sure if I had ordered that, I would be giving the place a 5. But, I decided that I had been eating a lot like I was on vacation and probably needed to be a bit more sensible. I got a grilled chicken salad and SG got the fajita special.They bring out corn bread to start with honey butter (needs more honey in that honey butter.) It comes out in this great little cast iron skillet. It is soo good. But do not get carried away, because your meal portions will be large too. My salad was big, but the bowl was bigger, making it look a little small. It had one chopped up grilled chicken breast and some delicious spicy ranch dressing. There was corn and beans in the salad too, so I felt like I was getting more vegetables. SG's fajitas were good. There was grilled meat and peppers, some salsa, guac and cheese. Only three tortillas come with the plate, but they are resonably sized. We both ordered bottomless iced teas and had them filled about a million times. Our server was great. She was fun and lively and the service was really good. This place is very good and I would go back to this or any of their locations. The food is always good quality. Best try that diablo chicken pasta sometime if you like spicey, creamy, yummy chicken pasta."
ke3RFq3mHEAoJE_kkRNhiQ,"This place never disappoints... The food is great and prices reasonable for the restaurant, not an everyday kind of thing. ..  I almost always come here with my boyfriend when we feel like having a great dinner night out...located right at tempe marketplace, you can walk right to the theater from there. I always order water with lemon at restaurants, but here it has to be the sweet tea...the huge mason jars with mint are a great combo...yummy:) The weekdays are quieter, but on the weekend they have a band playing the blues, so I dont' mind waiting for a table while listening to the music. The place is very comfortable, the staff is always helpful and welcoming.. The smoked chicken pasta is delicious, they used to have a pork chop plate with a tasty glaze and a sweet potato pancake, which was a favorite, but it's no longer served:( I don't know why i'm even mentioning it, but guess we both can't have it anyway, sweet memory i guess...hahaFried green tomatoes very good as well for a starter, if you order the rib tip as a starter you might not have room left for main course,They have huge portions so expect to take some home or share with someone. My boyfriend usually orders the catfish or steak, he's never had complaint- had a few bites myself, they are both really good.. The gumbo and jambalaya are very tasty and spicy, but more hot sauce never hurts....All in all, the place is relaxing, the food is great And the staff is very friendly.."
peA3F-PnIfijYr8HuG-A-Q,"Since I'm a glutton for punishment, I've read both of Ayn Rand's popular Objectivist novels. There are scenes from both The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged that remind me of the atmosphere at MercBar, and I really love pretending like I am a character in the books. I take nerd to the next level, obviously. The ambiance is timeless with the low couches, leather chairs, dark wood paneling, and super dim lighting. There are candles everywhere, and most of the customers come dressed very nicely. The drinks are fantastic! The bartender, Brent, makes the best drinks: take advantage of it if you are able to snag a drink from him. The waitresses are all very nice and will walk you through their signature cocktails if you so desire. I just tried the cheese and fruit plate, and I think it is the perfect pairing for any of the drinks on the menu. It provides a little something for your stomach while you throw all those drinks back. This is really the perfect place for a date or a group of friends. The atmosphere is very intimate, but the music lends itself to a fun environment as well."
zofs5Ig8kgvtFyp3ySoSBA,"This is my second time coming here, and I must say that the cupcakes are great. They have a lot of choices for cupcakes, and everything I have tasted has been awesome.I will break it down into Pros & Cons. Pros:Awesome tasteplenty of choicesSo far the girl that helped me has been nice (have not dealt with other staff)Nice decorationsCons:Staff is never there when you walk in, and do not show up for several minuteslimited cake flavorsI will expand on this last one.Every cupcake appears to be the same but with different toppings on top. It would be nice to have different flavors of cake with different toppings. Example would be that the Raspberry cupcake is regular cake with Raspberry frosting. I was hoping for Raspberry cake with some frosting stuff. Is that weird to want that?Overall this place is great for when you want a spendy but good tasting cake.The high prices will for sure help me not have too many repeat visits, and help with me losing weight. :)"
GV1P1x9eRb4iZHCxj5_IjA,"Being Puerto Rican and not having ANYWHERE good to go eat our food, I was excited about this place. I heard they had a great, inexpensive lunch. My husband and I went for dinner and could not be more disappointed.First off, I have to say that Puerto Rican food and Cuban food is 98% identical, with the minor differences still crossing the cultures. I was sad to see that this restaurant did not have arroz con gandules- a staple side dish, but the owner said she was not taught to make it. The ropa vieja was bland and just basically looked and tasted like 3 pounds of shredded beef sitting like a mountain on my plate. The relleno de papa ( potato ball) was cold on the inside. The pastele was OK and my husband's bisteca was just alright.The atmosphere of the restaurant really needs a makeover. I am always sad to see Hispanic restaurants that look mediocre because it makes me feel like we can't do a good job at our appearance, and that's just not true. Being a Hispanic designer, I know that for certain!I realize that many non-Hispanics might find the food here fantastic, but for Latinos I feel it will miss the mark. I wish their business success, as the owner husband and wife are VERY nice people. I just hope the food and variety will improve."
oB3LAXzg-GgnPbBRUsvxxw,"So you have to love breakfast.  It is a great meal that really begs for creativity.  There are so few places that have creative breakfasts (Palette was one) but most places just do the standard fare.  That would be Kiss the Cook.  Nothing special about it.  No magic applewood smoked turkey sausage with kumquat glaze, no french waffels - just your standard stuff.  They do it well though.  Think of it as basic breakfast without the grease.  The waitresses are great and have a ton of personality.  They really make this place a Four Star establishment.  The mini muffins that come before your meal is always a saving grace and they are the perfect size to tide you over till your food arrives.  That being said, your food won't take too long and you will get plenty of it.  I tried the french toast with a side of ham.  The toast was decent; with a hint of cinnamon.  Nice but not amazing.  The ham was a really good size and it tasted damn good.  The fresh squeezed OJ wasn't as good as Matt's but it was better than something from a carton. I'd go back here if I was out in Glendale for breakfast.  A great place with a ton of character.  The food isn't overwhelming but it is good enough for breakfast."
Ez2MFsVT5lJZ05yvK_0AXQ,"I've been coming to this location for years. I went to Israel in the summer of 2006 and when I came back to the states I refused to eat hummus because I didn't want to replace the memory of the amazing, authentic hummus I ate in Israel with some crappy hummus that you get in the grocery store. I didn't have hummus for over a year until I discovered Pita Jungle. their hummus (all 3 kinds) is the most authentic that I've found outside of Israel and New York. 2 months ago I brought my roommate who professed to hate hummus to pita jungle. By the end of dinner she was stealing all my hummus.Since the beginning of my interactions with pita jungle there is one thing that I have eaten the most frequently. The Fruit Fantasia (a plate of fruit and cheese) and the hummus starter. I'm going to let you in on a little secret: apples and hummus are delicious together. For the more adventurous people reading this try dipping the banana and the cheeses in to the hummus as well. YUMMMMM!The only reason why I give it a 4 is because they give less fruit and cheese than they used to. It used to be the best deal going because I could make 2 meals out of the platter for something like $8. Now it's $10 for the Fruit fantasia and I only get 1.5 meals out of it. Still worth it though.Bonus points: They have many healthy options for those people who are trying to watch what they eat."

The beds were comfortable, I loved that we could rock out to our own playlists with the IPOD radio, and there was a nice flat screen tv for our viewing pleasure. I'm picky about the products I use and was satisfied with the toiletries in the bathroom. There was shampoo, conditioner, body wash, a face bar, and lotion. All products were paraben free. My only complaint is that the bathroom door is like a sliding door and it doesn't close all the way. Luckily everyone was kind enough to warn each other before going number 2!This is a party hotel and people are going to party all hours of the night so if you are looking for a relaxing place to stay without the riff raff you should probably stay somewhere else.If you're looking to stay and play in Old Town Scottsdale this is a good choice. You'll be too busy to sweat  the small stuff."
tdeHd2AVYlEnz9F1UGb84Q,"Going to Cafe ZuZu at the Hotel Valley Ho was like hopping aboard Michael J. Fox's Delorean and traveling Back to the Future.  Back to the 70's to a simpler time, when life was beautiful all the time!  I loved the retro styling of this hotel!  It was intentional retro, not worn out dated retro.  The furnishings in Cafe ZuZu reminded me of the Jetsons!  But the ambiance reminded me of old time Hollywood.  I half expected Frank Sinatra to sit down next to me and sing me a song.I was there to meet my new friend Gabi for lunch, and I must say, we had a wonderful time.I had read up on Cafe ZuZu before going so I had kind of an idea of what to look for.   And I wanted to say that I was confused about some of the mixed reviews because being a foodie who is almost fanatical about fresh food and clean comfortable surroundings, I was very impressed.The restaurant was very clean.  Someone before had mentioned stains on booths, etc.  There was no such thing anywhere I could see.  The booth was clean and comfortable.  There were no crumbs, sticky spots, or fingerprints anywhere!  Very relaxing!The servers were right on top of things too!  Very friendly and helpful.  I was a little early and they didn't make me wait until my party got there.  I hate that when restaurants do that.  They let me sit, they served me, and they were very gracious.Gabi got there shortly and we were quickly served.  We both decided on the Ahi Tuna salad and boy was it fabulous!  Fresh ahi, lightly seared on the edges, perfect pink in the inside.  It was so delicious it melted in my mouth.  The greens were fresh too, just like they were just picked, and the dressing was just right.  Perfect for the tuna.  I loved this salad, and I am very picky about Ahi.I also was impressed by the rolls that they served.  They were not hot, I'm not sure if they were supposed to be, but they were yeasty, fresh and melted in my mouth too.  I noticed that the tops of them were browned and salted like a fresh pretzel.  It made for a very enjoyable roll.  I would have eaten all of them, but I was trying to be polite!  :)  Well I wouldn't have eaten quite ALL of them!I think the only thing you should be aware of is that there is no off-street parking, you need to valet park.  The valet's were friendly and fast.  But if you're not comfortable with valet parking, prepare to walk around the block or across a busy street.We loved our lunch and Cafe ZuZu and would highly recommend it.  It's a must see stop on a trip to Scottsdale, or just for a great lunch in Old Town!  Enjoy!"
#NAME?,"Since moving from CA to AZ, I couldn't find a decent Chinese restaurant.  Then I found this place and I couldn't be any happier.  The variety of food is endless.  And having the sushi station is a great plus.  Although the sushi station is quite a wait due to only 1 or 2 people working there at a time.  The mongolian noodle station is also great.  It's different from just having the regular chow mein.  And if you're not sure how to make it, just ask any of the cooks and they'll help you make the right mix.  Price:  $15 for all you can eat Chinese, and made to order sushi, plus a dessert bar.  You just can't beat it."
35uDzLpJlbSztgkJLtg1kw,"I.Love.This.Place.Adjacent to Changing Hands Bookstore, this small local change is fantastic, a great accompaniment to CHB and a great location (Guadalupe and McClintock) for a break from errands (or in my case, riding my bike-right around here is usually when I need to take a rest and eat something fast). Really warm and inviting, it reminds me of a classier Au Bon Pain (you Boston-ites will know what I'm spittin' here). A fast food restaurant that is tastier, cheaper, and friendlier than most ""sit down restaurants"". The set up (going from the entrance from CHB, not the door) is first off a sampling of their bread of the day with either butter or olive oil to dip in. You have the line with bagels right behind the cashiers, and a small bakery case to look at such good offerings as Chocolate Pumpkin muffins and their scones and cake slices. It can be a mad house here at lunch time, many people opting to take it to go-their sandwiches go on average 6-8 dollars-but they are huge, fresh and top notch-totally worth the price. Unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot of meat free or dairy free options for me for lunch right now (they have seasonal menus) but for all you carnivores-DAMN. Good soups too (I would avoid the weird, mushy tomato bread stuffing on the side and replace with chips-maybe you'll like it but I doubt it). They also have huge salads and pasta entrees for dinner times.Their breakfast and coffee is where they shine. The coffee is available at the self serve and they have a huge container of SOY MILK (yes!!!!!!) at your disposal. They can make tons of drinks and have tea as well, so if you're into that, prices seem market. But you have to try b-fest once here. Serve till 10am on weekdays, 2pm on weekends, they have stuffed french toast fruit, frittatas, I mean, it is soooooo delicious. AND FAST. If you can snag a table. Essentially you should try to have someone grab a table and tell you what they want since turnover is fast, but there are a LOT of people waiting to snag your seat (so don't linger either-its just kinda rude). The drill is you order the food, they give you a special flag for the table (if to go, you just wait near the kitchen and coffee kiosk), your coffee cup, you grab the coffee and grab a table and they bring it to you when ready. Pretty nice! Oh, and the staff is relentlessy friendly and efficient-I really don't know how they do it.They do have seating outside that is pretty nice and a ""trust"" option for their baguettes where you drop money off and grab a fresh one near the door so you don't have to deal with the line. So grabbing some bread for the week or dinner that night is a fantastic option as well."

Husband and I are on the same page, we have our favorite's but BJ's is up there. They cover the pizza with fresh toppings (no canned mushrooms here) and chunks of tomatoes. It's yummy.2.

X7FAAKkwOwaUUpR8QPChyw,"Splendid evening at Babaloos. Firstly, I'd like to thank Babaloos for the invitation, we had a really nice time. We've actually driven by a few times and were intrigued, but hadn't stopped in, that was a mistake! It's a very cute place, nice decor, the family seemed very nice, and well, let's get to the food, because it was absolutely scrumptious. We arrived at 7:30ish, sat at a table and were immediately welcomed with a couple refreshing mojitos. A few minutes later Croquetas de Jamon were passed around by the servers. Trying to hide as mozzarella sticks this appetizer was much more delicate, filled with ham and a bechamel and served with a Mornay sauce. All of the tastings were paired with wine, and in this case it was a very nice chardonnay.The second tasting was Amuse Bouche, a pineapple civiche, nice and crisp, paired with a pino grigio, which was perfect.My favorite dish of the evening (other than the dessert, which, do not fear, I will get to) was the Camarones en Salsa Verde. Sauteed shrimp with salsa verde, which was light and fresh and wonderful, but my favorite part of the dish was the roasted tomato with tropical pesto, it was so flavorful! That was paired with a red, Montecillo Crianza, which I thought was strange, since the dish was so light, but surprisingly it worked really well together.Next was the Ropa Vieja, flank steak slow cooked for hours in red wine, tomatoes, garlic, peppers and onions served with black beans and rice. This was exactly what I wanted after the lighter dishes, substantial, well cooked and comforting.Drumroll please, the finally...TRES LECHES, dessert was amazing, I'm not exaggerating at all. My husband described it like a delicate cake served on rice pudding, but I think it was more like eating a sweet cloud at sunrise. We were pretty stuffed when the dessert arrived, but after one bite, it was impossible to stop. Seriously, must try. It was paired with an awesome aged rum, which I'm not usually a big rum drinker, but totally appreciated this one. I'm writing this review, the day after, and am already craving to go back."
Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,"You know, for a chain, this place is pretty amazing. My mom and I go here often when I take her grocery shopping. The staff is very friendly and super-helpful. I've had a couple of the burgers, and the pot roast. Who's ever heard of pot roast at a chain fast-food place? Culver's does it, and it's good! There are plenty of sides to choose from. The ice cream is actually frozen custard, and oh my goodness! They do a special flavor each day, vanilla, and chocolate, with various configurations and mix-ins available. Prices are reasonable. Worth it!!"
uEJQSIjWui-TDWXaGlcqyQ,"My profile says....My Last Meal On Earth: Chicken and WafflesLo Lo's is the reason why.  Everytime I visit Arizona, I make sure I hit this spot up.  I usually order the 'Lo Lo's' meal which comes with 3 pieces of fried chicken, with 3 waffles and a scoop of butter with syrup.  YUM!  This meal would not be complete without ordering their super delicious Sweet Tea which is served in a glass jar.  There are two locations, one in lower Phoenix, and the other in Scottsdale.  The one in lower Phoenix is the original location.  However, it's much smaller so wait times could vary.  The Scottsdale location is much bigger,  so dealing with long wait times should not be as big of a  problem.Winner Winner Chicken Dinner, Lunch and Breakfast please."
h6jfMpTZpNduLG0wE2tbaw,"This is my favorite Sushi Spot in Phoenix. I see Sushi Chefs from other restaurants coming here to eat during their off time. =)The prices are very reasonable, and all of the rolls and sashimi are very fresh and crafted to perfection by the old timers.The Ramen Noodle Bowl is awesome, and nothing like what you would buy in the grocery store. It is topped with pork, fish cake, bamboo, and seaweed. I highly recommend.They even have a fried salmon skin roll, which was very flavorful and not always available at every establishment. I wish that i would have taken a picture of the last one that I purchased, it was absolutely perfect.They also offer Takoyaki, which is like an octopus dumpling ball. You would have no idea that it contained octopus unless you were familiar with the dish. these are absolutely amazing and highly addictive. You have to try these during your visit.The last time that I was there, I had to try the Ichigo Mochi Ice Cream. It was green tea ice cream, surrounded by a rice flour shell and topped with whipped cream. It really hit the spot and I was so full but in a happy and satisfying way.If you like Sushi, and you think that RA is cool, hit yourself on the head for being a complete fool and go check this place out and get schooled on what fresh authentic Sushi is all about. Your mouth will thank you for doing the right thing!Cheers and keep up the good work at the place.FYI... Bring your own Saki if you need booze with your meal. I say, just enjoy the good meal without alcohol and see how happy and relaxed the meal makes you feel."
MQNJNjLLDfsIrqxG-DBMqQ,"Visited there last weekend with my partner. Previously I was a Waffle House fan, but I have a new favorite now. I ordered the crazy combo, which is a 1/2 order of ham, bacon and sausage (yes, all three) 2 eggs, hash browns, and toast. First I'd like to address their half order of ham. We're talking almost an inch thick 6 inch wide hunk of ham. Seriously, between the ham, bacon and sausage, there was half a pig on my plate. I have to admit that I'm anal about my eggs. I always order them over medium, and this is one of the few places that ever gets that right.I didn't order the pancakes, but I saw it on another table and it was massive. Half an inch thick and bigger than the platter it came on. I'm afraid to see their Belgian waffles.Everything was wonderful. Coffee service was borderline obsessive-compulsive. That's always a good thing.I would be giving them 5 stars but my hash browns were more mushy than I like. We'll be back again."
jJhNOhuGpIsJX5SEUFFWYQ,"In Short: Long lines, complicated menu, and a fist full of dollars ........ for a hot dog?I guess I never bought into the whole gourmet hot dog fad, and probably never will.  I've heard my coworkers talk about the dogs, and on more than one occasion seen astronomical lines at the counter, so I thought why not, it had to be good, right?Talk about sticker shock, and only for a single dog?  Very overpriced indeed, on top of that, they managed to complicate a simple hot dog.  Various types of meats and topping options were a bit confusing, not because there were too many choices, but because non of them were really explained.  A little annoying for a first timer customer.  The dogs themselves are not bad, but I think you'd have to a complete idiot to mess up a hot dog.  I still don't get whats so amazing about it, definitely way too overpriced, won't go again.  They can keep their wieners and shove it!"
IVc23uY-36WUNYoIbz42Fg,"Update from my previous review:  I did contact the owner, Tom, with more info.  Per our email correspondence, the menu was correct, and the kitchen and wait staff needed to be re-trained.My brother and I ended up visiting Switch around New Year's, and our meal cost was covered (as mentioned in the owner comment below).  I ordered the Dragon Pita again and it was delicious, so it seems the re-training was helpful.  My brother ordered some sort of BLT sandwich and really liked it as well.I definitely appreciate a business that takes feedback (even on Yelp) as a learning/retraining opportunity, and one that will correct a bad experience, so I've upped my rating."
L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw,"The first thing I noticed was its nice patio area.  The second thing was its stand-in-line order process.  I completely agree with Gabi M, as having to wait until you reach the cashier to ask questions regarding the menu is quite annoying for us, and for the patrons waiting behind us.My wife was going to order the Rancher Salad, as it came with  grilled steak and caramelized onions.  Interesting note: the menu doesn't mention that the steak comes pre-grilled, served cold.  Good thing we asked.  Cold meat didn't sound that appetizing, so she deferred to the Liberty Bowl + Pasta.I was going to order the Salmon Plate but become enamored with the wood fired pizza oven, and went with a Margherita pie.  Good thing!  The salmon comes cured and served cold (the online menu didnt mention that, but the store menu did).  I also ordered a cup of caprese pasta salad.While we waited near a boisterous table, we noticed how loud it can get inside, as it echos.My cavatappi pasta in my caprese pasta salad was fairly dry, although it did come with grape tomatoes and tiny balls of fresh Mozzarella cheese which were good.  I wouldn't order it again though.The cavatappi pasta also made an appearance in my wife's Liberty Bowl entree.  I would have opted for a penne or spaghetti or linguine, but am sure its much easier on the kitchen to have to prepare one pasta type.  I liked the sauce, but found the meatball to be almost chalky, but definitely crumbly, with a taste reminiscent of Chef Boyardee meat nads.  My wife didn't want to eat them.  I smooshed one on my plate and photographed it for your viewing pleasure.The saving grace was their wood fired pizza.  The crust was fantastic.  Thin but not cracker crisp.  It was crisp on the outside, but soft inside, with a great taste.  I highly recommend this menu item.  They used a fresh crushed tomato sauce, which was spot-on.  I commend them for this, as they could have opted for the easy way out, using the Liberty Bowl maranara sauce.Their dessert case did not contain many appealing offerings.  Most of them just looked dry.  For example, refer to my photos of the brownies and cinnamon rolls.  I agree with my wife.  If you are going to display something in a case for all to see, make sure its fresh and remains visually appealing.  If you're unable to accomplish this, why have a dessert case?  Where's the allure?Sorry Liberty Market.  Our first trip was very disappointing, which means it will probably be our last."
FY_OXEVcewAQFZuu6fynLA,"I was a virgin until today... that is a Z's Greek virgin!  So was Christina P!We decided to try it for the first time together... and I think we were both pleasantly surprised.  I'm actually rounding up from a 3.5 rating since I'm in a good mood... but if you're in the mood for Greek, I recommend trying this place; especially if you don't care much about atmosphere.  The place itself feels a bit like a fast food restaurant.  It's a fast casual concept where you order at the counter and they bring your food to you.  They also check-in to make sure everything is ok; extremely friendly staff.We shared a hummus appetizer and I had a large Greek Salad with chicken.  Christina went for a falafel pita.  Their pita is fresh and moist and I ate more than my share of it... the hummus is good too but maybe missing a little something.  My salad was perfectly dressed and came with lots of chicken.  The chicken wasn't the best I've had but I'm extremely picky when it comes to chicken; i ate most of it anyways.  The prices are extremely reasonable.The reason I am rounding up my rating?  WiFi and drive through... yes, they have a working drive through and I can guarantee I will be taking advantage of that sometime soon!I will be back; nice to have another solid Greek restaurant in my 'hood!"

coXomDOValXzks6BwMHG1A,"I have learned one very important rule and it is that I'm only allowed to order bruschetta at Postino. Period. End of story. That said, the butternut squash soup was delicious as was my one bite of the Steak sandwich, which I might just order myself next time. The space itself has a much warmer, intimate feel than expected. It appeared so bright and coffee house like on the website that it was actually a deterrent. I get it, your space is clean and you want to showcase that but it really does give the wrong impression. I also understand the concept of lighting for photography purposes but it appears bright and uninviting, definitely not date worthy. Anyway, I'm glad I was wrong.The cocktail list was uninspired and I don't recommend bringing a beer geek here, but if you're into sharing some munchies and splitting a bottle of reasonably priced wine, this (and about 20 other spots in the valley) is your place. No offense to The Living Room, I will surely be back, It's just that I'd really love to see a restaurant owner bring something fresh and new to the table. I feel like everyone is doing a version of this...I too noticed the flickering light issue but being that I'm not prone to seizures it didn't bother me much. The service was on point and our server was attentive without being overbearing and seemed to genuinely care that we enjoy ourselves. When questioned regarding wine options he actually had an opinion and some basic knowledge to back it up. That may seem sad to get excited about but hey, I've gotten used to vapid shitty service, even coming out of some seemingly 5 star establishments. We came, we drank, (a lot) we dined, (not enough) and we took cheap cab rides home. Ahhhh, the beauty of living in Mid-town.  I'll be back Living Room; I'm not in love...but you're a perfectly acceptable rebound/transition until the next best thing comes along."
KTF-E3NfkJy2wiwcgOPyVQ,"Totties is just about one of the best restaurants  I have been to lately.  I am reasonably certain that all their food is good but I probably will never know as the only two items I get EVERY time I go are their spring rolls and their Beef Pho Tai soup!  It is that good!  The spring rolls have chunks of pork and fresh shrimp and are laced throughout with cilantro and rice.  They are amazing.  My boyfriend and I douse them thoroughly in their delicious peanut sauce that we doctor up with soy sauce, plum sance and a spicy red sauce.     Then we have the Pho Tai which seriously even  if I was a step away from death and sick with a cold I would still  drive to Totties to have instead of that crappy Campbells Chicken Noodle Soup.    The owner (Tottie- go figure!) told me that she makes the beef broth with beef marrow which sounds really gross until you have it.  There is an undescribable seasoning (marrow?) in the soup that is just delicious.   And that is another dish that you doctor right up- add a little bean sprouts, fresh mint, fresh cilantro, leetle bit of peanut sauce, soy sauce and you are done.  We practically want to scrape the bowl clean.  Being from Scottsdale and watching my girlish figure, it is pretty embarrassing that I am practically jabbing the boyfriend to get to the soup!So that is it!  The new location is beautiful and I hope that they have great success there as it has more panache than their first location.  Yum!"
rZbHg4ACfN3iShdsT47WKQ,"The atmosphere is unique, unlike other bar-b-que places I've been to. The patio is much like a garden patio at a home with brick walls and plants high enough to block the traffic / side street noises.  The indoors has a rustic, yet, elligant patio feel to it with the brick walls and rustic wood ceilings.  The furniture is again, more of a patio feel than a typical bar-b-que restaurant.  The noise level was not too loud that you couldn't hear people at your own table. The food was wonderful! Although my husband said their burger was too greasy, that was the only downfall.  My brother and I had the St. Louis ribs.  The way they caramelize the bar-b-que sauce on the ribs is great. They aren't runny with sauce dripping down your hand. The rib meat falls off the bone and easy enough to eat with a fork or picking it up. The sides were great. I had the macaroni and cheese which was definitely homemade. Not runny and not too dry. The cheese flavor was not too strong either.  I would  be prepared to wait a bit for a table because they appeared to always be busy. Overall, I really enjoyed this place and would go back again!"

Don't believe me when I tell you that the lunch buffet here consists of about a dozen main dishes and at least ten of them are superb.  Please don't believe me about just how delicious the tikka masalas are, or the saag paneer (creamy Indian cheese and spinach).  Please, please, don't believe any of it, because if you do, then you will start coming here and your friends will follow and soon I won't be able to get a table.Seriously, the secret of Indian Paradise is that they cook everything very expertly.  The only downside -- it is a relatively small buffet -- is really a blessing in disguise, because if they had even one more option, I would have to try it and would then be unable to rise from my chair at the end of the meal.Here is what you will get (in general, as the menu varies somewhat from day to day): chicken tandoori, chicken and/or goat curry (their goat is a rare misfire, often too bony), chicken or cheese tikki masala, at least one creamy spinach dish, a couple of other meat entrees, lentils, several vegetarian options, at least one of which will be pretty spicy, rice, naan and one other bread, a couple of appetisers (like samosas, for example), a half dozen sauces, and rice pudding and honeyed cheese balls for dessert.

We've been twice; once the service was barely acceptable and once the service was the worst I have ever had in my life. God only knows why we gave it a second chance. The waitress barely acknowledged us and then completely disappeared midway through our meal. We tried in vain to get the attention of several others, including a manager, to get our check. We ended up waiting at least half an hour, and that was after my husband got up and convinced someone to give a &^%@#.  We both left with the distinct feeling that if we were Hispanic, this would not have happened. The food was average: decent chips, good spice level, greasy cheese."

Calamari and shrimp ceviche, prosciutto with cantaloupe salad, pork loin ratatouille, and a dessert of fresh strawberries with sweet whipped cream over puff pastry drizzled with chocolate... it was perfect!  We brought cases of wine and champagne and we had a beautiful, fun wine bar. For an evening in mid May, the weather completely cooperated and we were able to dine on the front porch.

You're stupid.  Anyway, the sushi was better than that of the RA in Chicago, so I was pleased.

Eventually we did get the other half, after those who got their food were finished. The quality of the food was awful. The server forgot the second round twice. We had to go up to the bar and wait about 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us to give us our tab. At the bar there were other people complaining about the poor service. Needless to say I am never going back; which is a shame because this could be a really great place."
YeDYa6tYL16CyqYvUVOtLw,"They definitely spared no expense in decorating the joint! Very Disney-esque, but kinda fun.  However, I found the food very 'eh' - just ok.  And it's really LOUD IN THERE.  Which makes it hard to talk to your table companions.  I'd recommend sitting outside near the fountains."

Kudos to who put it together.Almost seemed a shame to eat it! The server was prompt, very friendly, and extremely helpful when it came to choosing what we wanted to combo up.I would not hesitate to come here again and would totally recommend this place to all my grass munching friends.."
lKQ5hnkSQ-XP80jNCH46nQ,"First of all, I'm usually skeptical of restaurant reviews in those free city magazines you see when traveling. When we arrived in Phoenix our luggage didn't so we were stuck in airport reading all the ""what to do in..."" literature. Distrito was featured in Where and the photo caught me right away; the design looked funky and inviting. We decided to give it a try and boy did it prove my skeptisicm wrong. Excellent experience from start to finish. When you walk in you are met by a wall of Day of the Dead masks and bright colors everywhere. Our server, Chris, made it a special night. He knew the menu and instilled a fun attitude. The menu is tapas style and the prices are well worth the quality. The food came fast, was hot, fresh, and delicious. Great service. And the food was exceptional. We loved guac, which was made at a station fresh, the ceviches and the carnitas tacos. Highly recommend."
kfveMaYeaqGVNHPitT4O9w,"The food is bomb. Atomic style. Ok, it's not spicy at all, but it is freaking delicious.I had one hell of a goose chase trying to find some chinese food on this weeknight. It's past 9PM on a Monday, and I can't find anything decent. It's Scottsdale, so my only choices are: Panda Express in Mesa, Jimmy Woo's (no thanks, eww), or go hungry. I settled, and drove to KFC thinking that if I was going to settle for something other than Chinese, I could get a double down, and try and go all suicidal. Then KFC let me down by forcing me to wait 10 minutes because all their filets were frozen. Eff that noise. I drove around aimlessly and somehow stumbled upon Pita House. It was like a sight for sore eyes.I've lived in Scottsdale for just over a year. I've been out and about in the area quite a bit, but for some reason I've never actually been to the Pita House. Probably because it does look a little weird. I guess I shouldn't judge a book by it's cover, because this place was awesome.Tonight, I ordered the Chicken Shawarma with an extra chicken skewer. It came with a side salad. I was pleasantly surprised to find a very thick garlic sauce (very similar to the one at Zankou Chicken in LA, see my review). Amazing. So garlicky, citrusy, and perfect.The chicken was moist and juicy. The kind that makes you want to put your mouth all up in it. Mmm hmm. Yeah. It's very nice.My meal was about 10 bucks. I devoured everything set in front of me. If you are into Hookah, they have hookah specials from 4-9, and also, some sort of lunch special for Gyros.If I wasn't moving away, I'd be here more often.Next time I am in Scottsdale, I will eat here, and grab some Falafel. Seems like people like it.Lastly, the staff seems very nice. The guy who helped me (I think he was the owner) was super cool and friendly."
T9iBSa4pxYXP129pHlt5Sg,"I had dinner here with my wife last night for my birthday.  I can best describe our dinning experience by using the best urban adjective I can think of...our experience at Kai was RE-DONK-U-LOUS!  The whole dining experience was like watching a ballet. Every move our waiter (Daniel) and his assistant made was well choreographed, purposeful, and symbolic. Each menu cover has a watercolor painting that is designed by local Pima elder Mike Medicine Horse Zillioux (he is also the flute player you will hear in the back ground while you eat). In addition, each menu cover design comes with a story given by our waiter. The wine list was extensive and the sommelier was very knowledgeable on the list, but the sommelier self-admitted  that  the list needed some updating since some of the wines listed were not in stock. However, no ding here from us. As the sun was sitting, Daniel (our waiter), pulled back one layer of the curtains in our room, which gave an effect of the wonderful colors of a setting sun in the entire dining room. After the sun was half way down the Estrella Mountains did Daniel pull back the final layer of the curtains and we were in such awe...FOOD:THE BEGINNING (Appetizer)We started with the Lobster Degustation. This dish was made up of three lobster dishes. The first was a buttered braised lobster tail under an avocado mousse, tear drop salsa, & lobster coral. Second lobster dish was lobster knuckles in sweet corn panna cotta with sour radishes. Third, was a lobster cobbler with mesquite meal & burnt Irish porter cheese (this one was my personal best!)THE JOURNEY (Entree):Wife had the Red Deer Venison Loin with Sage Infused Gnocchi. The venison was prepared with a spiced sweet chile & fair trade coffee rub served under a broccoli rabe puree, shaved pecorino & currant jam. Wife describes it has tender and flavorful without any of the game taste that sometimes come with venison.I had the the Grilled Tenderloin of Buffalo from the Cheyenne River Tribe. This dish was prepared under smoked corn puree, cholla buds, Merquez Sausage (chorizo) and scarlet runner bean chili, and Saguaro blossom syrup. Again, no game taste and very tender. The buffalo was cooked so well that it was like cutting into some butter. WOW! THE AFTERLIFE (Dessert):We had the Creme Brulee Meets Old World which consisted three creme brulee dishes. The first dish was an Eclair inspired creme brulee, which was a mesquite meal choux & lavender custard. Second, was ice cream sandwich inspired. It was made from two pieces of ginger snap in between a Mexican vanilla bean ice cream creme brulee. The final dish was a meringue pie creme brulee that was a masa pastry tart & meyer lemon meringue. Great dessert! It was such a wonderful experience! Every detail of our dining experience was thought out carefully. From our forks and spoons being warm to the touch when our main courses came out and to them being chilled when we received our desserts."
yc5AH9H71xJidA_J2mChLA,"We planned a happy hour here this past Fri night.  I had heard good things so I was really looking forward to some fun with good friends and good beer.  Unfortunately, I was drastically disappointed.  The service was absolutely terrible.  The question of ""What do you have on tap?"" should not be a difficult one to answer.  Our server didnt feel like answering and instead pointed to the menus with attitude as if we were making her night miserable.  Strike One.Our group quickly turned from 4 to 8.  When we turned to our server to assist us in relocating to a larger table, she told us we could look around if we wanted to, but she didnt think it was possible to accomodate a party of 8.  We asked about the upstairs and she told us there was a private party and no room.   A friend of mine went up anyways, to see a perfectly open table with 8 lovely chairs.  He asked the private party, which was paying the check and getting ready to leave, if they minded we sit at the other table.  Of course, they didnt care at all and we moved ourselves.Strike Two.Despite the bad attitude and completely unaccomodating service, we managed to rack up quite a bill between all of us.  I waited tables for four years and consider it a given with such a large party and hefty bill to offer separate checks.  Before we could even ask, the SINGLE check was dropped with 18% Gratuity added to it.       Stike Three.The food was average at best.  I've had better Potato Skins at TGI Fridays.  Its a shame, because this place is a $5 cab ride from my home and I really wanted to like it.  I will make the drive to Rula Bula over this place any day."
uKSX1n1RoAzGq4bV8GPHVg,"Either I was only given half a menu, or there is extremely limited choices for food selections?  (yes, the goat cheese appie, the only teaser on the menu other than a type of glorified French fry, was good).  The wine list was also small - 5 whites by the glass, a few more reds.  The (back bacon?) sandwhich I shared was very greasy & oily - ick.We were invited to a Devoured Kick-Off event in which we were told we would be involved with 9 bartenders from different establishments who were going to make their concoctions, and that we would be able to try them all.  We were told to sit outside, even though we were early and there was available seating at the bar.  Well, unless you were seated directly at the tiny bar - about 5 or 6 seats on either side - there was no chance for any tastings, as anyone seated there got them all to themselves.  After a few pours, we indicated there seemed to be a situation and were told that no problem: continue sitting outside and they will soon be passing them around.  Didn't happen.  After about  1/2 way through, we realized we would not be partaking of any libations.  We indicated our displeasure, a refund was given, but we were definitely & hugely disappointed.  {We had about 3 other events we had been invited to on this same night, 1 being a free preview screening of a new movie, the other was a new restaurant much closer to home}, and needless to say we were bummed at missing out on better opportunities we had turned down.  Driving all the way here for what?  (Oh, any bar service was, of course, taking forever since it was full of bartenders for the event, so waiting for drinks in any way sucked all around).I should point out that the manager very chivalrously proffered 2 signature Lemonade Cocktails upon overhearing our disappointing dilemma regarding the Martini Tastings.I guess all was not lost, since Halo was across the street & I had been wanting to pop in there for a new custom jewelry piece for a piercing.  Overall, I seriously doubt I'd be back, considering how far from home this is, and all the other many alternates we passed on the way getting there.  But I would be ok with recommending it to someone who either lives nearby, driving past there anyhow, had something else to do in the area.  It is certainly an establishment which seems to be shiny and new in an area which is tired and drab.  Seems to be out of place where it is.  Would I go if it was located in say, Old Town?  maybe I'd give it 6 months before I thought about that. but maybe..."

Very nice compared to the ghetto ones Im used to (Da Vang - Phoenix)Now onto the food, I ordered one of their rice plates. I forget what its actually called but it came with grilled pork, egg, shrimp, rice, veggies, and this square thingy. My brother ordered the Pho. My dish was very very good and I highly recommend it. I cleaned my plate and my brother slurped down his soup. Next time Ill order the Pho. As far as prices, they were ok, but I wasn't going to complain.

9Y3aQAVITkEJYe5vLZr13w,"Breakfast Club is one of my favorite weekend hangover cures. One of the reasons I like it is because they DON'T have a bar, so there's no possible way for me to order a mimosa or screwdriver. Sometimes the best way to live a healthier life is to just avoid the temptation all together. I've been going to Breakfast Club for years, so this review is based on several visits, not one particular experience. A lot of people dog on this place for being too ""Snottsdale"" (and I've surely seen that attitude SOME of the time), but overall, I've had good experiences here. First off, great bacon....thick and yummy. I suggest ordering a side order when you first sit down (you know...as a ""breakfast appetizer""). Second, good coffee. Last, last but not least, the food. I LOVE their breakfast burrito and can't seem to order anything else. I recommend it ""Monster Style,"" smothered in pork green chile and chorizo queso. Then, I recommend that you walk about 5 miles to stave off heart failure. It's a lot of food."
lPAHpSIc2MvY06bWxrFRiw,"Went there Sunday 8-29-10 with my two kiddos.I had gone with the pure intention of trying out the supposedly fiery ""Hellza-Poppin'"" burger, with Pepper Jack, Jalapenos, and Habanero sauce.  I love hot and spicy foods to a fault.The burger was indeed a little spicy.  Nothing overly hot, however, as it did not have my face sweating or have me craving a glass of milk, which REALLY hot food does to me.If you are the dude among your friends (as I am) who is known as the ""king of eating hot stuff"" you might be a little disappointed in the Hellza-Poppin' burger.Summing up the Hellza-Poppin':  Tasty, but not a volcano in your mouth.You definitely taste the heat, but it's not overwhelmingly hot.  Unless you are a hot food wussy, in which case you should stay away from this burger.If I were to ""scale"" this burger on a heat scale, basing it on other places in town you can get TRULY HOT food (Los Dos Molinos, Arriba's side order of Hatch chiles) I would have to put it on about a 6.5 out of 10.My daughter had the original Steakenburger and was not overly impressed either.  Adding the shaved steak to the two patties did not really make the burger better.  The shaved steak actually tasted kind of stale to me when I tried it.  Maybe it was a little bit old.The wings were very good, though.  My son had the ""mild"" and he loved them.Onion rings were also above average.We'd go back, maybe just for the wings."
yypKLRJxSjR2uNaTS_O6pw,"Yum.  I could end my review there, but my mystery ""fans"" might be disappointed.We had a late lunch on a Sunday afternoon, and the place was almost empty.  I'm glad about that because I didn't care for the layout of the dining room.  Unless the room had been set up for a large group that had left, with the exception of counter seating and a few four-top pub tables, all the seating was 2 long rows of small tables placed about 6 inches from each other.  Although it does make it easy to set up tables for groups of any size, I'm not fond of sitting on a stranger's lap generally.  We started with a small caprese plate with house-made burrata, pesto, cherry tomatoes, balsamic, and ciabatta toasts.  We were starving, so we devoured it pretty quickly, leading the server to comment ""you finished that already?""  Yes, we did, it was a small, and it was delicious.  But I appreciated her not outright saying, ""wow, nice job fat-ass.""Next up was the potato and roasted garlic pizza with fontina, gorgonzola, leeks, rosemary, and the addition of prosciutto.  My husband insisted I choose the pizza, and I loved every bite of it!  And the best part was I loved every bite of it because he didn't.  So I generously suggested he order another pizza knowing I would have it all to myself.  He went with the pepperoni.  Although they are very generous with the pepperoni, it's still just a pepperoni pizza.  The sauce was a little sweet for me, but I prefer a spicier sauce.  Can't wait to come back and try the pistachio pizza.  And for the record, no soggy crust!Suffice it to say...Yum."
fF6m3qsD5blnwuZRuYhzWg,"No bueno.  We read about this restaurant in one of the Moon's AZ books as a place to try for good, New Mexican food = not.  It was worse then Chevy's...the margaritas tasted like water and I got so sick during dinner from the food & margarita I was donzo for the night.Also, you're definitely not coming for the ambiance, it's definitely a hole of wall.  It would've been fine if the food made up for it - but you're better off at a chain restaurant down the street."
wqIB7hUTQnCswJV4UyYyEQ,"I don't think Capital Grille is all that...For the prices, you expect the BEST service, quality, atmosphere, etc.  And the handful of meals I've had at Capital Grille have been fine, but not worth the $$.  Most recently, 4 of us went to celebrate our friend Jack's birthday.  I was impressed to see that they had graffiti on the table and a card for the birthday boy, but I was less impressed with the rest of the meal.  We did enjoy our appetizers (calamari, prosciutto wrapped mozzarella, lobster mac n cheese, fresh oysters on the half shell, and a Caesar salad).  The oysters were actually the highlight of my meal.  I should've just had those with a glass of the Sauv Blanc and called it a day... but instead, we ordered more food!  Each couple split a sirloin (none of us loved it even though the menu describes it saying ""You won't find a more flavorful steak."")  We also had a side of corn and a side of mushrooms... I guess we did have a lot of food!On top of that, the birthday boy chose 2 desserts for the table: the strawberry cheesecake and the keylime pie.  We didn't even make a dent in either as they were nothing to write home about... and the waiter brought a candle out after the fact.  So, $300 later, we walked out the door saying how much fun we had with our friends but that Capital Grille, sadly, is quite overrated.  At least the dogs will have some leftover steak for the next few days, but I won't rush back to Capital Grille anytime soon, especially if I have to pay!"
tb24fvNJfHhyKEXkKn12Xw,"Retro setting, organic food, and friendly service.FOODWell, it's a diner so you have burgers, fries, grilled cheese, etc to choose from. The burgers have always been cooked as I like them (whatever your preference is...) The fries are organic potatoes, cut daily- sometimes a little on the brown side in appearance but they always taste good. Grilled cheese is great- not too greasy like some places. There are sodas and iced tea to drink- both organic.ENVIRONMENT8  seats inside and outdoor seating availible. I would recommend eating outside if it is nice- sometimes inside is crowded and everyone can hear everyone else's business. OTHERBring cash, no cards accepted. If your service is good- tip them.

TQhP4vCMjvX527YMxPfuUA,"My favorite Middle Eastern restaurant in all of eternity is Haji Baba in Tempe. Is it any wonder, then, why I am so deflatedly underwhelmed by MBFGR? If you want a real hamburger, you don't go to Denny's, you go to Chuck Box. My analogy stands. Totally bland and mediocre food, flavors distilled to barely detectable levels for the masses. The saginaki is good, but not bursting with tangy lemony sizzling energy like it should. The server's half-hearted ""opa"" was fitting. They don't even light it next to the table anymore, making me wonder if their liability insurance put the kibosh on such activities after a particular incident, maybe or maybe not involving the singing off of a customer's facial hair. The spinach salad was absolutely coated in a syrupy balsamic dressing that was practically cloying in its sweetness. The pita is good, although its thick, spongy, white-bread consistency isn't particularly what I expect in a good pita. The sangria was a tick superior to Boone's. Meh all around."

Sorry Carl's Jr...your $6 burger -- really?  I had the number 3 here - yeah sounds like a secret Chinese sauce, but better!  My burger was cooked just right - juicy and medium-well.

I was really impressed that they would proactively reach out and try to make it right, and I was happy to return and give them a second chance.(In the message, he also let me know that you can order your burger cooked to order, and they're happy to cook to medium...That's good to know and a huge plus in my eyes.)I returned today for lunch and asked for the manager (at his request), he came out, introduced himself and we chatted briefly. He was a really nice guy, took my order, and paid for my lunch. I was prepared to pay, so that was a really nice surprise. I ordered the same thing I did last time (Bacon Cheeseburger, side of fries and a drink) to make it a good comparison. They brought me my food, and it was night and day from my last visit. The burger was cooked medium, juicy and flavorful. The coal fired cooking process shines through when the burger is cooked like this, and it was really delicious. The cheese and bacon add a lot to that, and their barbeque sauce is a nice addition to the burger. Fries seemed a bit better than last time, they're very crispy which I like. Needless to say I was impressed with my food.All the other great stuff from my previous review still stands, I love the organic concept, it's really nice inside, very clean, the service is friendly and that soda machine remains great. I'll definitely be back. It's expensive, but worth it, and the fact that they were so accommodating and willing to make it right for me raises them another couple notches in my book. I highly recommend going, ordering your burger medium or medium well (depending on how you like it) and I think you'll be impressed."

The California Crunch rolls were tasty, the spicy Crab was a big hit with my friend, and the Crunchy Tempura Shrimp with eel sauce was my favorite.  We also tried one of their many special rolls, we went for the ""Booty Booty Roll"" not just for the name but because it seemed to have a complex flavor profile.  based on our personal tastes, we didn't find the  Booty Booty Roll to be ""Rockin Everywhere""but it was good, just maybe too many flavors at once, I would probably go for something simpler next time.

It seemed good in theory on a cool day in Scottsdale with temperatures only in the seventies. However, being right on Scottsdale Road, it was hard to hear the people I was eating with because of all the passing traffic. I'd advise that anyone dining here eat inside (where it unfortunately can also be a little loud since the place is always busy)."
bQ1s5pqX_UVWVQ-k4e9rAg,"i was in an abnormal mood for pulled pork so hit this place up to try and satisfy my annoying craving. Staff was very nice, Cool pictures and two tv's as well. Not a place to really hang out for hours on end or anything. beer selection is very minimal as well. We ordered a lot of food. pulled pork sandwich, a sampler and also the hotlink with mustard appetizer. baled potato salad, mac n cheese cornbread etc.Everything was good. Don't really have any complaints. I have not ventured to many BBQ places in the area so i cant really compare, so for now they get an A-OK until i venture off and have someone to compare them too.."
2JZv-P1lDKOPKvefQlYDEQ,"Donald S. just reminded me I had not reviewed the Village Tavern yet.Eat at your own risk, I can only tell you my experience and you do with it what you like. I la la la loved the food here, used to dine in regularly and happy hour often until. Dun dun dun dun, one evening my girlfriends and I rendezvous at the Tavern for a little happy hour. It was not happy and we left in well under an hour. Just after being sat in the bar area we saw the biggest freakin rat. It would have made NY proud! We packed it in and disappeared into the night never to return. :( Sad tale for a place I loved so much. It's like breaking up with someone you still have feelings for but you know it's the right thing to do."
eGevCRobYnA_HSj60sEWvQ,"Pita Jungle is easily one of my all time favorite restaurants. The dark, candle-lit atmosphere and the local artwork that is featured makes for a really chill place to have a delicious dinner.  I personally love the broiled chicken pita, a simple chicken pita with a little extra flavor. The hummus and chicken is also really tasty. They also have really good iced-tea. The place usually is pretty busy, but I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated and their service is always quick. This is the perfect place to go whether with a group of good friends or on a date."
3ez4Qs56C_cC-l8x08l6Zw,"Metro Brasserie offers the best value for your French dining dollar in town.  Compared to Vincent on Camelback, Christopher's, Zinc Bistro, Coup des Tartes and Sophie's French Bistro, Metro Brasserie is THE go-to French restaurant in Phoenix.  Metro Brasserie fills a HUGE void in this town by offering delicious French food at a reasonable price.  I really want to give this restaurant five stars but I just can't.  The problem is the menu.  It needs a re-write.  The descriptions are simplified to the point that the menu does not clearly set a diner's expectations.  The prime example was the dish my BF ordered.  The menu described it as ""Poulet Rouge:  roasted chicken, Carolina-Gold rice, vegetables"" ($17).  From the description, I envisioned roasted chicken on a pile of plain rice with a veggie medley.  When I asked our waiter, he clarified that the rice is actually a risotto and they take the meat from the wing and the thigh and blend it into the risotto.  The chicken breast is cooked and rolled in the crispy skin.  Hello?  That's nowhere near what I expected from the menu.  The two women seated near us who were conversing in French called the waiter over after they received their food.  The woman who ordered the chicken had to ask the waiter if she received the correct dish as she didn't recognize it.  The way the chicken breast is rolled and the skin is crisped, when the kitchen slices it into medallions to place on top of the risotto, it looks more like bacon-wrapped scallops.  It's fine to under-promise and over-deliver, but this menu is a clunker and it gets in the way of the excellent food. We started off with the Fried Green Tomatoes ($11).  When the menu mentioned that they would be served with blue crab, I figured there would be a speck or two on the plate.  I was delightfully surprised when the tomatoes arrived absolutely covered in huge chunks of crab.  This is a generous amount of crab and the combination of the warm, crunchy tomatoes with the cool crab and the sauce remoulade was perfectly balanced.  The doughy texture of the bread reminded me of the bread sticks at the Olive Garden with a harder crust.  They were good and the warm bread was nicely complimented with herbed butter.  However, I expect mini baguettes to offer up the traditional symphony of crunch that sets them apart. Both of us ordered the Frisee au Lardons ($9).  I expected the salad to be frisee tossed with a warm bacon dressing served with lardons (bacon cubes), a poached egg and a crouton.  The menu mentioned a Creole mustard dressing, but I didn't expect the salad to be served cold.  When I asked the waiter about it, he said he would talk to kitchen because it was supposed to be warm.  On his second stop by the table after I brought it up, I finally told the waiter that the fact the salad was served on an ice cold plate (which would have been a good thing if the salad was supposed to be cold), likely contributed to cooling off the dressing.  However, the frisee showed no wilting at all so I don't believe it was ever heated.  The menu description needs to be tweaked.  I would not order this salad again given the cold dressing and I feel like the menu should have told me that.  Maybe a lot of folks who dine here aren't familiar enough with French food to have expectations for classic dishes like this, but the menu should disclose when they're monkeying around with a standard.I had the Brasserie Burger ($12) and it was utter perfection.  This is bad news for Delux as the burger here is flat-out amazing.  Order it.  You will not be disappointed.  It's the best burger in town.  I splashed out the extra $2 for the Pommes Frites.  They were delicious and serving them in a paper-lined mini metal bucket is genius because it keeps them warm.  The BF had the aforementioned Poulet Rouge.  He's not the type of guy to order chicken in a restaurant, but both of us agreed we would order this dish again.  The breast meat was perfectly moist and the skin that was crisped around it was utterly delectable.  The one change this dish needs is more aggressive seasoning of the risotto.  Otherwise, this is fantastic and a screaming deal for $17.  To round out the meal, we had the Sticky Toffee Pudding ($7) and it was excellent.  The warm cake was a nice contrast to the pistachio gelato.  The ice cream arrived a bit melty on the plate, but the flavor combination was spot on.  The cr??me fraiche was a really nice counterpoint to the sweetness.Check out the crazy restrooms!  Like Christopher's, they are awfully spacious... After enjoying a fantastic meal at Metro Brasserie, I am surprised that I didn't catch on that the concept of this restaurant is ""French country meets the American South"" until I read it on their web site.  True, the fried green tomatoes should have been a huge clue, but it didn't come across via the d??cor or the menu.   Metro Brasserie is our new go-to French restaurant.  We will be back!"
Zx8_4zKdDBSO3qGrkukBIA,"I just went here for lunch.  I really have nothing to add to the other reviews on here because they pretty much all sum it up.  It gets crowded, the ordering process is a clusterfuk, they place looks sketchy and dirty, the staff is very friendly and helpful, yada yada.  The place isn't worth all the hype but definitely is worth a visit if you are in the mood for something unique.  Its not the healthiest or highest quality cuisine, but it is a pretty solid place and worth a shot.* Jerk Chicken = very good* Pollo Diablo = spicy and awesome and my stomach is going to hate me later* Jade Red Chicken = excellent* Pork Fried Rice = very good* Red Salsa Stuff = excellent* Refried Beans = standard* Snickerdoodle Cookie = awesome"
qjmCVYkwP-HDa35jwYucbQ,"Another tough one that will require revisiting and re-scoring in a few to several months, if things change. Had a few visits so far, with generally good but mixed results.THE CONCEPT - 4 StarsI'm no Weil disciple who drops to their knees and goes all agape for his every utterance. But I think he is the perfect partner for a Fox concept, as long as the fresh, fresh, fresh motto is adhered to over the long term. I like some of the Fox places (okay one, Greene House) and it's the same chef that opened True Food.My Dad was recently diagnosed with Seliac Disease and seeing more and more restaurants acknowledge that dietary restriction on gluten is important to a growing segment of people is refreshing. The menu makes it easy to distinguish between various dietary regimens and other considerations, in both food and drink. I eat anything, but it sure makes it easier to eat with those who are justifiably (and sometimes unjustifiably) conscious of what they put in their bodies.Everything from the mixed drinks to the food items seems to be VERY fresh, or at least sourced very well.THE SPACE - 4 StarsSimple, modern, open California kitchen appeal. I like how they raised the ceiling of the old Coffee Plantation shithole. The mural wall and the over-sized lamps are fun. Open kitchens are always a little more fun and give you something to talk about if your date is lacking in conversational acumen.THE EXECUTION (for now) - 3 StarsServiceThey're trying. Things still seem jittery with some of the servers. Have seen a lot of food go to the wrong tables and places. I'm sure they'll work through that. Everyone is friendly, but not necessarily knowledgable about the food. Sure they've memorized the spiel, but these aren't foodie servers. They're young, friendly folks working at a hip spot.FoodHave tried several things that were tasty and fresh, if not particularly interesting. They just kind of show you that you can eat stuff that is relatively healthy and not have it taste like nothing. A few things so far have shined: the spelt pizzas have a unique, chewy crust and nice toppings. The Kale Salad is unique and delicious. Nice textures. The Shrimp Dumplings are nice, but make you yearn to eat real chinese, or make your own like you like 'em. Steak Tacos are of the Fresh Mex variety but have a great char.On the downside...I had the Turkey Bolognese Penne. To me, there is never an excuse for overcooked pasta. If you cook it, and it's overdone, throw it away and cook it again. Check your pasta, it's the heart of the dish. I neglected to order ""al dente"" because so many places give you that look like ""But of course, signore!"" And you shouldn't have to ask for pasta to be done that way. That's the only way it should be done, unless you're eating Spaghettios. As for the sauce, it tasted like diced San Marzano's which is great! But if you use the canned San Marzano's omit the little pieces with the unchewable stem base. Cut that part out or pitch the piece. I added shrimp to the dish at the server's suggestions, despite my past history of NOT combining shrimp and turkey. Call me crazy, but that's just not a combo I yearn for. Would have been fine though, except that the shrimp were completely undercooked. I eat shrimp raw, when I intend to, but that clear uncooked shrimp is not the texture you want in a cooked dish. At sashimi/sushi, yes. Pasta, no. Seems to happen a lot though. And no discernible seasoning or flavor to them either.My wife's salmon was largely flavorless, and very rare. Fine for us as we love raw salmon. But at a certain point, she just would have preferred sashimi and the accompanying soy sauce. I'm sure the amount or rareness would have been a problem for many diners. Especially when combined with almost no salt. On that note, the fresh fish crudo of the day was a nice hamachi with an excellent yuzu/miso (? - that's what it tasted like) sauce. BOTTOM LINE - 3 Stars for nowI could see this going either way in the future, but if they stay fresh and improve on the execution, it's a no-brainer that they will end up a 4 star. I don't think they'll ever hit 5 stars, just because their commitment to the healthy stuff and a very broad appeal will keep them from really being able to push it from a culinary standpoint."
7WGBi29_vj_7RcPVxpLNHA,"I've been to this part of Gilbert before to eat at other restaurants in the area, but finally made it to the Farmhouse this morning for brunch.  I've been meaning to come here for some time, but seem to make it after its closed!My friend and I pulled up for a very late breakfast, and the place was hopping. Its located immediately next door to Liberty market, and there was a line outside waiting to get in.  The place is small, so there's no waiting inside.  Also, when we got here, I found out from another customer that we had to put our own names on the waiting list! I don't mind waiting, but had no clue that we had to sign our own names!  Anyways, it was only about a 20 minute wait or so, but we were starting to get hot, so we finally got a seat in the shade near the misters once the crowd started to thin out.Inside, the place is small, but the seating seems fair.  No hanging out in the aisles, or else you block the servers!  Despite being crazy busy, we were waited on almost immediately.  No problems there.  Service was quick and efficient, and at one point I think we counted 7 servers!  Menu is full of selection, a little bit of everything.  I went with the #19 omelette, which was loaded full of veggies and cheese. Spinach, cheese, tomatos, etc. It came with some tasty hash browns and two huge slices of toast! My friend with the big john (I think, I can't remember) and he loved it! He also got the chocolate milk and it looked really good.Anyways, I would love to return as the food was really good and service seemed to be top notch.  The only sucky thing is really waiting outside.  Go here if you can. Seems to be a really original type place."
aRkYtXfmEKYG-eTDf_qUsw,"I was hesitant at first. I haven't experienced good transitions from sole coffee bar to coffee & alcohol bar. However... that being said... Lux has pulled it off. The coffee and alcohol components are separate yet beautiful in their own right. Since I am not much of a drinker.. I come during the day.The pastries are so eloquently done. You can see each of their wonder delicious calories without struggling. The only frustration points are how the crowd tends to gather at the coffee bar and it makes for a bit of a traffic jam. Hopefully that'll resolve as the days go on.Most of the chairs are rather hard. Such is life. I'll be back."
erBoatMp1TFi_NPxTigp6w,"Interior is something to behold, but it's not impressive enough to keep one coming back. So, what about the drinks? Sangria is okay; margaritas aren't anything to write home about. So, what does this place offer? It's certainly not the grub. The salsa tastes like burnt rubber. The namesake dish (pink taco) is a mess on a plate. If you want to go to say you went - to say you had the pink taco - then go, but don't say I didn't warn ya. This place epitomizes all that's wrong in the world, or atleast what's defunct about Scottsdale. Flashy baubles, boobie bouncin' women, marked up mediocrity and the air of popularity that's so desired, service and quality are jeopardized. Uhm, no thanks."
MXOdsPTLQPsQK9hUq01DWg,"I agree with the above comment. I live in the neighborhood as well and was very excited to see Arcadia Tavern open, hoping it would still have the neighborhood charm of Western Pizza and Red Tomato. I was wowed by the size of the place and the number of flat screens, but unfortunately the food and service were so so. I've tried to go back several times but each time the parking lot is packed and there's no space at the adjacent lots. Who exactly is filling up these spaces??? The restaurant never looks busy from the outside...Due to the lack of parking at Arcadia I found myself ending up at Blackforest Mill and Jts. Both of which I have found to have great food and great drink prices. So to those who will probably venture to Arcadia Grill like I did and be turned away by lack of parking, head over to one of these bars instead. I think you will be pleasantly surprised by the food and drinks."
VY_tvNUCCXGXQeSvJl757Q,"Why did I think going here was a good idea?For some reason, I thought that Mellow Mushroom was going to be some kind of pizza bistro, with emphasis on the 60's. Boy was I wrong. First off, this sports bar doesn't know what it is. Being a graphic designer, I know about the funky concept of branding, which this upscale TGI-Fridays completely tosses out the window. From the 60's font on the outside of the building, to the Modern skyline artwork on the walls, to the 10 different genres of t-shirts the servers wear, this place is chaotic and terrifying. And the food experience was even worse. First off, we got the Artichoke dip, which was ok. It was hot, which was nice, but I prefer a nice crust on the top of mine, which didn't happen. Then came the 45 minute wait for our pizza, which was then delivered to another table. 15 minutes after that, our server realized what happened, and to be fair, she was very apologetic, and it wasn't her fault, it was the fault of the runners. So, they made up another pie, and a manager gave us a comp meal and 2 free pizzas, which is nice and earns them a star. As for the pizza, we got the buffalo chicken pizza, which really needed more chicken and hot sauce. Most of what I had was a cheese & ranch pizza. The chicken was tasty, though very sparse, and the hot sauce was tangy, which is what I expect. I only wish there was more. The dough was very good though, and the pizza tasted decently cold the next morning. Slight hints of sweetness come through the crust, which was nice.However, the disaster that occurred there, along with the schizophrenic atmosphere has chased me away for good. I will be using those coupons though when the time arises.Lastly, looking around at other tables, I do not recommend the Pretzels. I see that there is an image of them on here, DO NOT BE FOOLED. I see NO reason to have to wait 20 minutes for Pretzels that are not even the size of a hand."
Kh7cW1rcbxzsgTzAfqEcGw,"Bagel Man, you rock! I've visited this place two times now, and I have been very pleased each time. The bagels are super authentic, the real deal. Chewy, flavorful and totally fresh. The Bagel Man himself has been behind the counter on both of my visits, and he's super friendly. He bakes and boils the bagels himself and the quality shows. On my first visit a few months ago, I ordered the Sexy sandwich on a pumpernickel bagel (my favorite!), which if I recall, was a sandwich wiith turkey, havarti and roasted red peppers among other things. I got a combo which included a drink and a side, I chose the plain Wise potato chips. It was all tasty and fresh. On my second visit, I just went with a toasted pumpernickel with cream cheese and an untoasted everything bagel to go. I also noticed the big black and white cookies in the pastry case, so I had to throw one of those in as well. The bagels were top notch as usual, and the black and white cookie was good too. I'd never had one before but immediately thought of Seinfeld when I saw it. These cookies are more akin to half of a whoopie pie (very cake-like) iced in simple vanilla and chocolate frostings. I didn't ask if they were made in-house, but they may be. My one and only gripe about the place is the ambiance. It's in a strip mall so my expectations weren't that high but it would go a long way in increasing the inviting nature of the place if they had some music playing. All in all, if you're looking for authentic, chewy bagels, look no further than the Bagel Man!"
bgTB6MgdVQssXhkNJ7qIfw,"The place was pretentious as hell. Waitress took forever to get us water and ask for drinks. I got a shiso lime shochu. That was bad, really bad. The pineapple shochu was OK. Got a few rolls, nothing special. Didn't try any of the more signature dishes or a ""tasting"", but overall I'd say over-hyped."
UIGFrEcoDsw05I1UOrxdOA,"Cyclo is over-hyped in my opinion. Two major set-backs for me is the rude and curt owner-hostess, Justina Duong. She is just plain obnoxious and fails in her attempt to be humorous and charming. She actually believes that she is a culinary standard bearer in the Valley.The other is based on several breeches of hygienic standards. I have seen stuff that made me cringe. I love pho and Vietnamese food beaucoup, but I won't return on foot, taxi, car or pedal car.Call me a Dinky Dau Long Nose, but I just don't get the appeal."
me3myIgtuIgLEC5jd97uZw,"I feel like Top's has been getting angrier and more bitter over time.  I called on Fourth of July just to see if they were open and they guy on the other line told me, ""Yeah and we're a madhouse.  Each minute I spend on the phone with you is another body out the door,"" and hung up on me.I wanted to call back and tell him, ""You know, the amount of time that it took you to say that, you probably lost two bodies out there door.  You could have just said, 'Yes we are!' and that would have sufficed.  Instead, you had to be snarky so I'm calling you back specifically to waste your time.""Instead, I'm just going to Yelp about it.On multiple occasions coming back over the past few months, I feel like I'm tip-toeing through the house when someone's mad at me.  I don't get it.  There's a serious vibe of negativity going on.  Specifically, the guy who acted like a fuckface over the phone has been snarky and bitchy a few times to me.  Oh, and refrigerate your fucking beer.

6md4A90THda31wTg1bB3hg,"This place is absolutely fabulous, for many reasons.  First and foremost, the food.  I ordered two large pizzas to go (cheese and vegetarian).  Both were absolutely delicious!  The crust is thin and light, the cheese melts in your mouth, the sauce ultra flavorful, and the veggies were fresh and cooked to perfection.  It was a definite hit with everyone.The location is a bit hidden (it's in an industrial neighborhood), but still very convenient as it is right across the street from Tempe Marketplace.  The interior was charming, with brick walls and small tables - reminescint of what I envision a small pizza parlor in Italy to look and feel like.Although the prices are higher than you would find at a Dominos or Pizza Hut, so is the quality of the food - therefore, worth the extra few bucks.Finally, the staff was amazing.  I had approached the manager for a small food donation for a local charity, and he went above and beyond to provide us with ample food for all involved and made our charity experience that much more memorable.Overall, this place is definitely worth a stop (or two, or three)!"
9tSHBEoAhKu-tkU8n6SKjA,"It's ""OK"".  I love spicy food, and like someone else said, some of their dishes seem spicy just to be spicy foregoing full flavor.  Their Margaritas are too sweet, IMO, but do pack a punch.  I also think their food is too salty, specifically their tortillas.  I also would NOT recommend the Mesa, AZ location.  It is nowhere near the quality of the Phoenix location.  I have been to the Phoenix location 8 times and the Mesa location 2 times and both Mesa experiences were sub-par.  If I were to rate based on the Mesa location I would give it a 1 or 2 star rating."
7pxa5tueoEcmt6hztqsz2A,"I know it's greasy. I also know that whenever I eat it, I get a feeling in my stomach like I swallowed a rock. Chinese food is supposed to be greasy, but there's often something a little off about Pei Wei. So why the 3 stars? Because they have the most incredible, firm, flavorful tofu ever. It's not a nice dark skin around it and it takes on the flavor of their oh-so-sodium-filled sauces without becoming a soggy mess. It really is tofu perfection. I also appreciate their awesome to-go options (order online or on your mobile browser) and the fact that they notate on their menu (with a leaf) which options are vegetarian. This place isn't the best Chinese ever, but I think it's decent if you're looking for something fast and very vegetarian-friendly."
fVgrpVyp-nPLTac9YIjTug,"One of the most impressive spots in town. Lunch here is a luxury experience - the grounds are amazingly beautiful, and the menu surprisingly affordable.

UmhTiNOKareQDP7D9aAnKw,"Want to be clear - this review was for Cuoco Pazzo, NOT the tavern that replaced it... (they automatically changed the name, but didn't start a new review page)...I really miss Cuoco Pazzo and wish they wouldn't have closed...review below:Been here three times now, and if this review were based strictly on the first two visits it would receive a full five stars.  The food was outstanding - we made sure to compliment the chef - the service was prompt and friendly, a great drink menu, and really nice ambiance.  I highly recommended this place to out-of-towners, or just to people who had never been there.  However, on my most recent (and third) visit, we noticed that this place had started to slip a bit.  It was very empty on a Saturday night - which probably isn't a good sign.  Despite how empty it was, the service was very slow and it took surprisingly long for simple items like a bowl of soup to arrive.  They'd done away with their cocktail list on their drink menu too.  The food, when it came, was still just as good, but it seems like they'd cut back  - and it showed.  Really rooting for this place since their food is so good and I had two really good experiences there."
jRfdz5voj40P6WS9L54caw,"Went for brunch on Sunday with 5 people.   WOW!.  The butternut squash corn enchiladas with tomatillo sauce was one of the best Mexican dishes I have ever had... and I live in Mexico for most of the year!  This dish is also available for dinner and would be plenty of food (three enchildas plus a substantial salad.)

7QSYBp2-AOdyUJXEaLnbgA,"This place is the best place I've eaten out of all the times I've visited the Phoenix area. My friends took me here when I was visiting last weekend and I really hope we go back next time I'm in town! The cornbread was amazingly delicious with the jalapenos inside and caramelized top. I split the chicken, green rice, and cucumber salad with one of my friends and the other ordered the ribs. Of course we all sampled each others meals. The ribs are without a doubt the best I've ever had and I would make that my standard order as the meat literally falls off the bone before you bite into it! The chicken was great, but not really covered in bbq sauce; it was moist and came off the bone easily. Rice was great and something I've never heard of before; I forget what was in it exactly, but I think it was cilantro or something similar. Cucumber salad was fantastic with it's cucumber, avocado, corn, greek olives, fresh feta cheese and peppers. I had a really great glass of Riesling from a German winery; wish I could remember which one it was, but it was very smooth. The waitstaff was fast and courteous. I love that there is a dress code for guys as it adds to the classiness of this place."
ZdQbDVZWDsO-d7q2qW8E3A,"Thanks once again to ASBA's Leslie Barrett for recommending another excellent restaurant in the Valley. George & Son's doesn't sound like much, but it is. It's the best Chinese inspired restaurant we've been to in the Phoenix Metro area so far. The vegetable dishes, fried rice and especially the Kung Pao 3 Seas - with shrimp, scallops and the most wonderful white fish - were all excellent. The Tom Yum Gum Thai soup was light on lemon grass but strong on Thai basil and so was a thumbs up, too. We enjoyed the friendly service. The only disappointment was the sizzling calamari, which had a little too much fried batter but did have an excellent use of onions and peppers on the dish, and the Singapore Sling that was too sweet for our taste. We've been to the Raffles Hotel in Singapore and so we're a bit spoiled there. Don't let that stop you - sail away to George & Son's and enjoy great Chinese and Asian food with a Tsingtao beer. Highly recommended."
HIiVx2mseVWKtx8TKfWC_A,"Sophie B. has me very confused:  You can get a sandwich & a drink for like under $10 bucks @ the Duck.All the sandwiches are handmade right in front of your very face -- any time a restaurant prepares the food where the whole wide world can watch them do it tells me they're proud of their work & their food.  And they should be -- it's great!  They even have each pickle wedge individually wrapped in foil -- take as many as you want (within reason).   :-)I've been a customer of the Duck since long before most of you moved to Phoenix.  Consistency -- nice people, excellent food, reasonable prices, wide selections of wines & soft drinks, seating indoors - outdoors - upstairs.  No worries - The Duck is always good."
EfXg0Bnv4RAbP4xfgxSiiw,"12/22/10Nice space, but a bit too ""cool.""  That is, I don't find the atmosphere here beckoning me to stay awhile.  More of the ""order something, or get out.""  I don't mean to say this attitude is coming from the people there.  No- it's the vibe that I get from the furniture, from the brightness of the room, and from the music played at too loud a volume level.  I really like coffee shops that play music at a softer volume so that I may hear conversations I'm having w/ friends, or be able to read w/out having to work to tune out the noise.  (I tried using my iPod here once, but I couldn't stand the high volume level necessary to block out the shop's own music!)Read much about how great the food here, but since everything seems pre-packaged and processed (meats, cheese, sauces), and I couldn't get the rep to tell me which local bakery supplied the breads, I can only order the black tea (the green tea is tropical-flavored, meaning it's off-limits to me).  I did try the iced mocha latte, minus the ""white chocolate powder mix"" it is normally made w/, but the beverage tasted like it was missing something to round out the flavor and texture.  Yes, I know that's where the white chocolate mix comes in, but I can't have it, so I wonder what ingredient Brosenbrus could add next time to give the drink more creaminess, more oomph?  The shop also offers soy milk, but I'm trying to stay away from the preservatives that are also present in the liquid...Free wi-fi-- I like to come here when I have extra time before my massage at nearby SWIHA."
hCtyvahPsEOUb38LKxEQNQ,"As a general rule, most people are drawn to things they can't or shouldn't have.And with good reason. Once you cross the line, partaking in life's ill-gotten fruits, you wish you hadn't.This is where life whips out its great equalizer...the sudden realization that you've just fucked-up....getting involved with something never meant to be. I'm talking about Coal Burger.The many times we sat on the patio at Stingray Sushi, looking longingly across the way at Coal Burger. Its packed house. The people waiting for tables.The wafting aroma of flame broiled beef. It was too much. We were sucked in like a Vietnamese basket-whore, (so i hear) despite neither of us liking ground beef all that much.Missing lunch, we came here for an early dinner...like way early...like 4:30 early.There was us and one other party in the entire place.This is where CB defied all logical thinking patterns. Service was poor, and the burger even worse.We were informed when ordering how all burgers were cooked medium unless specified differently. Fine. I ordered extremely well, asking the meat be caramelized. My wife, medium.My wife's burger was rare, as in seared outside, tartare inside.Mine wasn't caramelized, unless black is the new caramel.How does this happen when there are only five (5) guests in the entire restaurant?There was a replacement burger and plenty of apologies, but that's not what I'm looking for when I spend twenty five bucks on two burgers and beers. CB...if your main product is burgers, and your default cooking method is medium, you might want to weigh the idea of having a timer somewhere in the kitchen...like next to the grill.What a waste."
HIiVx2mseVWKtx8TKfWC_A,"This is my favorite deli in Phoenix. Two words: Vermont Treat. (Made with Maple Glazed Ham, Pinenuts, Spinach, Sliced Apples, Duck and Decanter's Famous Cheddar Cheese Spread on Multigrain.)I like this place because I always know what I want (see above), and anyone I bring with me can always find something that fits their tastes, too. For the indecisive bunch, Duck & Decanter offers a list of signature sandwiches with the ingredients already listed. And for the pickier, er, more decided folks, D&D can make custom sandwiches, too -- you can choose your bread, meat, and toppings.The ready-made pastas and other sides here are delicious, too, but I rarely get them, because their sandwiches are already so filling!**Helpful Hint: You must, must, must either beat the lunch crowd or postpone your visit until after the lunch hour, otherwise you'll be at the end of a very long line.**"
qwmHm3s8p7J12AIY6Co8HQ,"I've eaten at this Pita Jungle many times and never seemed to be completely satisfied.  The food is ok and there are so many other choices for Greek food that serve a better appetizing meal.I'm confused about what the management's idea of having the front of the house staff wear just about anything they choose.  I like the idea of trying to be urban, hip, and trendy, but not sold on the abercrombie/skater look as a substitute.  Honestly most of the attire I've seen here seems to be more like what a young teenage slob would choose.Otherwise this place isn't a horrible place to eat at.  Food is decent to good at best, decor is pretty cool, portions are large, and prices are about average.  For a chain this is a little better than most and the concept helps it stand out from others as well.I'll be back, but I know I won't fall in love with Pita Jungle."

qNoNkF1yJctEs3t40VkX4w,"I wanted Mexican food. I've been on a Mexican food kick. Nevermind that I had Rosa's on Friday. I wanted Mexican food on a new day - Saturday.A good girlfriend of mine suggest Blue Adobe. It's close to your house, she said. I gave a mental shrug and thought, ""why not?""I had passed Blue Adobe many times on my way to the Mesa Arts Center and had always meant to try it. But each time I passed, it always looked closed. The dark windows they have are very deceptive my friend, very deceptive. Plus, the lack of cars in the parking lot always made me think they were closed, too!So I pulled up. Then I saw the cars parked *behind* the building. OH!Walked in and thought it was decorated quite tastefully, although their chairs leave a bit more to be desired.Chips and salsa were good, I'll give them that. Service was good, too. I think it helped that my friend had been there several times. When she arrived, the server's eyes perked up - I kid you not! He clearly had seen her in there before.I looked over the menu and realized it's NEW Mexican cuisine. Sorry, I'm not a fan of New Mexico food. When I want Mexican, I want MEXICAN. Don't give me Tex-Mex or New Mex shit.So...strike one for them.My friend got the beef lettuce wraps. She raved about how fabulous they were. I kept looking at her lettuce thinking, ""It's freaking iceberg lettuce. How can you be happy with that?""I ended up getting their salmon, lettuce and tomato sandwich...it came with fries. The dish was aight for me, but it didn't make me want to do my little happy dance. The bacon was nice. The salmon was nice...and their bread for it was a bit like a ... pita? I didn't pay attention to the bread, thinking it would be a regular ole type of sandwich bread. Nerp. Toast has more substance.The bonus about the fries? They were unsalted.I read all the laudatory reviews - best new cafe in 2007, blah blah blah. Culinary delight to the senses...yada yada yada.I can sum it up with one letter in quick succession: ZZzzzzZzzzzI'll give this place another shot some other time, but for now I'm gonna leave it be.If you like New Mexican cuisine, this is the place fer ya. If you want down home plain ole Mexican food, stick to Rosa's (which is what I will do). And hell, should I ever decide I can't hold out on a Sunday for Mexican food because Rosa's is closed, I'll go to Rosita's. Yea, their lack of windows still has great issues for me, but I will take their food any day over Blue Adobe."

Of course, the Chocolate Cake dessert is a nice ending for the meal.The service can be a bit slow at times, depends on the server.

rIonUa02zMz_ki8eF-Adug,"Five Guys opened on Mill today in the old Coffee Plantation location.  The place was bright, loud and busy. I was immediately impressed with how many people they had working; I counted 14 just behind the counter. They had classic rock playing so loud you could barely hear them call out order numbers and the people behind the counter were yelling and laughing. It's a pretty fun experience for lunch.I ordered the little bacon cheeseburger, cajun fries and regular drink. The burger was decent (not In and Out quality, but pretty good). I really liked that they let you load up on your choice of toppings (I got grilled onions, mushrooms, lettuce, tomato and pickles) they also had green peppers, jalapeno peppers, bbq and A1 sauce. I was a little disappointed with the price as $10.24 seemed a bit high. They didn't have shakes  which was a major let down. All in all it was pretty good, but not much better than Fat Burger which is just down the block on Mill. I'll be interested to see how they far in the long run."
3vKhV2ELR2hmwlnoNqYWaA,Bagels are pretty good! They have so many different kinds and I was like a kid in a candy shop. I would have loved to order a bunch of bagels especially the most desert ones the like cinnamon ones. Only thing I was kinda sad about was when I ordered my juice I thought it would be fresh since it said fresh juice but the apple juice came from a 'Tree Top' or some brand like that container. Major bummer but I went there for the bagel not the juice. Still an awesome bagel. My only suggestion would be getting the Simply Apple juice if fresh is not possible.
Mh85-BDqDHlngT8G2ZnRWg,"I like the cozy, home-style atmosphere.I like the cashier's charming, inviting attitude.I like the options for toppings.I like the dessert selection.I like your prices.But I just can't get into your pizza. Maybe it's my fault for ordering by the slice, and not a whole pie. I'm not expecting the freshest product, but I think mine was reheated more than once. Even individual servings shouldn't have rock-hard crust or visibly burnt edges. I understand that this place has a lot of heart, and for that I'm sure I'll give it another try for something beyond pizza, which I am a snob about. Had it been in pristine condition, IDK what about it would jump out. For now, it's a mystery why my friends are giving it nothing but 4+ stars."

rwQIBAM_kHtVl1Ks8Flexw,"Eeehhh, it was just mediocre. My brother and I went here when he was in town. He liked his rolls, I wasn't crazy about mine. The rolls I got just weren't great tasting, and they were way too big. I am not sure if anyone knows what I am talking about, but I hate it when rolls are too big. I like a nice bite size roll. Nothing is worse than when you can not eat a roll in one piece. Rolls were not meant to be eaten in pieces. Nothing is worse than putting a roll in your mouth and barely being able to chew it, because it is so big. Maybe these places think Americans like everything bigger and are trying to accommodate us?My brother lives in a really small town and doesn't  experience a lot of sushi, so his standards are slightly lower than mine. I definitely will not be seeking out this place, and will only go back if I have to."
mPGgxatANSPw9KbMluhXkA,"I gave this a 3 star because I've had better Thai in the East Valley. Just got back from Latitude 8 with a friend for lunch. The place is a little difficult to find. Direction: Take a right after the Boston St to the parking lot. It's a little hard to see but it's the first entry after Boston St.The place is a modern, contemporary restaurant which was a little unusual especially for a Thai restaurant. I ordered the Yellow Chicken Curry which was really tasty!! The presentation of the dish was very neat and appealing. The only thing that bothered me about it was, they served the dish on a HUGE plate which gave an out-of-proportion feel when consuming my meal and they gave you a small dish for your rice. I think it was weird in a sense that when eating my meal I was eating from two different plates. I think I'm just being weird. HA!Also, bring a sweater. This place gets cold!! Either that or I'm just a wimp. I was satisfied with the service. The guy who took our order was friendly and was always filling my water THANKS!"

I often have the veal chop, or a nice, big NY Strip.  Twice baked potatoes, creamed spinach......you know the routine in the ""good old boys' steakhouse.""

yJr24Yy1K6bt2G9fX3_zPA,"Oh no oh no oh no :[ The decline of one of my favorite restaurants is upon us, which makes me very sad. This might be a bit long as I normally hold Havana Caf?? very near and dear to my heart. Over the last 4 years I have been to each of the three locations (north valley, Central and Chandler - which has since closed) and loved each. Consistently good food, drinks, and service. The past few times I have visited, I've started to see the signs of a decline in quality, but last night really sealed the deal. The mojitos - These are what DRIVE me to the restaurant. I have long said that the mojitos at Havana Caf?? are my very favorite libations that have ever crossed my lips. Always very fresh, not too sweet, lots of mint, and perfectly strong. Last night they tasted like they came from a MIX. I do have to say that they were quite strong, so that was nice as I do enjoy a bit of a buzz, but that was about the only redeeming quality. A microscopic amount of mint, syrupy taste, and why on god's green earth were they PINK?! They were never pink before! The food - I had my usual, the Paradise Pulled Pork. It was tasty as always! They have definitely messed with the portions though. You used to get an equal amount of pork, to the rice and bean mixture. That being said, you still get a considerable amount of food. But for $20 it stung a bit to be given the shaft on my tasty shredded swine. My honey had the Gambas y Pollo which we really enjoyed. It was quite tasty! Yummy sauce that complimented the shrimp quite well.The service - Really pretty bad. The man who took care of us (and the only one who was there serving) was not outright rude, but I felt like we were interrupting the bookkeeping that he was doing at the table in the corner, by coming in to eat (we were not the only people there). When my man asked him whether he liked the mojito or the caipirinha better, he made sort of a big deal of saying that in the (large amount) of years he has worked there, he has never tried either as they just don't appeal to him. An odd answer for sure, but I guess honest. He gave both of us a really crappy vibe. While we were there he actually threw something at the busboy. I have experienced this man before - and once saw him repeatedly being extremely rude to a guest on the patio over the entire course of my dinner. I don't know the whole story but it was very off-putting. That experience almost had me saying I was not going to come back to this location, but what can I say, it's always been a fav of mine. I REALLY hope this was a fluke, as I would hate to see such a previously amazing restaurant take this bad of a nose dive. I almost feel like I've lost a best friend. TL;DR - Great food. Definitely overpriced especially on account of the shrinking portions. Shitty service. POOR mojitos (which previously would knock my socks off)."
YkFBelUWinftlweJzuiIAw,"I freely admit that I am a cookie whore.  Imagine the Cookie Monster glammed up and walking Van Buren.  Yep, that would be me - doing anything for a cookie.  Or maybe that makes me a Cookie Hooker,  a tried-and-true Cook-ker perhaps?  Anyhow, along comes Urban Cookies on an increasingly cool part of 7th St.  to make me consider settling down for this AZ goodie.  Well, I haven't quite settled down or anything -  I'm still shoppin around.  But, the ""Simple Urban"" cookie which is their simple milk chocolate chip - is one noble effort.  Not quite the best cookies ever, but a valiant try.The mix of ingredients and baking on this is really good.  Perhaps a little too soft from the June heat, but not bad.  Besides being 99% organic, it's soft, chewy, with just the right taste of vanilla and wheat.  The owners are a married couple who bake early in the morning and spend the rest of the day packaging the treats for sale, either one-by-one or by the dozen.   They market themselves as the hip, funky alternative to Mrs. Fields - and they're about right on.These cookies haven't quite made a religious convert out of me or made the Cookie Monster in me give up walking Van Buren - but still good nevertheless."

iV7D7fHKb-bF9fCL_bEMtA,"Cork is an enigma.What makes it enigmatic is how damn good it is... Too good for Chandler and maybe too good for the valley.The portions are just right, and anybody that tells you otherwise is a fat ass or a glutton (I'm 6'3, 200lbs. and I was satisfied).  If you want large portions though, go to their lunch/brunches.  I've been there twice and had The Lamb Chop, which was amazing on all levels, and I've had some serious lamb in rural Bosnia, which has been labeled the best in their country... sure enough cork's stood up blow for blow.  The other entr??e I experienced was the buttermilk fried chicken.  I was so amazed by the lamb the first time, that I had to try something more ""simple"" in order to qualify their food in regards to regular places.  Let's just say the chicken was not regular, it was outstanding.  The appetizers are crazy good... can anyone say king crab legs?The wine selection is top notch.  the booze selection is killin, and they even make this amazing Italian lemon stuff that's like 90% alcohol.  make sure you have a designated driver, because this place will inspire winos and boozers to indulge to their fullest.Go to Cork, because it's that damn good!"

The buddy that I went with said ""man, the last time I came here, the service was BAD.""  Why I didn't heed his comment and go to any of the other 50 restaurants within a 2 mile radius, I don't know.We walk in the front door, and there are 10+ people waiting to be seated.  No evidence of a hostess, nothing.  We stand there for maybe 5 minutes, during which time several various employees walked through the room, none of who payed any attention to the fact that there are now about 12 people waiting for any sign of life and ultimately a place to park our rear ends and get a menu.  We decided to go into the bar area, which was pretty full with the same vibe of no employees, lots of patrons, nothing happening.By some miracle, we were finally seated by a mute hostess, and it then took about 10 minutes to hear from anyone else.  From the time we sat down until the time we left, about 1hr and 10 minutes passed.  Every step of the way was us waiting for someone to take our drink order, waiting for the drinks, (just WATER by the way.....no bartender required) waiting to order, waiting for the food, waiting for water refills, waiting for our check, waiting to wait for something else.The food - decent, but who cares.Not going back there anytime soon."

They were out of just about everything we wanted to order. So disappointing. However I decided to give them a second shot. Everyone has a rough night.

29hR24tcAM3JZaXfA5xCxQ,"When I see 4 1/2 stars and over 60 reviews... expectations are set.  Clearly I am in the minority, but deseo fell flat.The service, from the hostess to the server to the bus boy was on point.  In no way do I want to take away from the people who accommodated a late dinner, great job.   The decor was fine, I still felt like I was in a hotel basement and I really got the vibe it used to be a sushi joint, but that wasn't really the issue. The issue was, for the amount and quality of the food... I felt like we got robbed.My dinner companion tried to order our appetizer twice because he didn't realize we had already eaten it, and he is not missing any screws (that I know of). Delicious yes, substantial no; don't be fooled the kobe beef tenderloin on casabe flatbread is not as hearty as it sounds.  It was the size of my hand cut into 4 smaller-than-tostitos-restaurant-style chips, and this coming from a girl who will fight for a seat at tapas joints.  I understand the concept of ordering several plates and sharing, here you need several plates to yourself and you pay for it.  The soup comes in a bowl bigger than my sink and contained literally a few spoonfuls; for what its worth the consistency on this dish wasn't too great... chunks that sunk to the bottom with super thin almost broth fill the rest of the space.  The arroz tostado en cazuela was a fantastic side dish, and actually ended up being most of my dinner because more came with that, than my actual meal.I don't really want to keep going because I know I am against the grain here, so put it down to an uneducated diner if you want to scoff... but I felt guilty when the bill came.The place was not bad, by any means, but overall it was just A-OK when I was expecting a higher level of dining based off Yelp.  I would be embarrassed to recommend this place for a certain price point dining experience, even to people with oodles and oodles of money to burn looking to eat latin american cuisine, in a faux sushi bar, at a hotel.  I feel there are plenty of other places I would rather go for the money, although I'm not above admitting that improper expectations could be the reason we were so disappointed."

By the time I got my order placed, no one in front of me, all three were being used and the only one open was next to one occupied by a one pretty woman just over 1/2 my age.  I left my number and went off to fill my iced tea glass and in that 2 minutes she was gone and the table was already cleared for the next guest.  Drat, scared off another one.:-(  Over the next 25 minutes that I was there the dining area did indeed clear out some but not as much as I expected.  Between the open kitchen, the music and all the talking I thought the noise level was pretty high.My meal took about 10 minutes to arrive which I think is about right.  I ordered the limited time offering of Thai mango chicken with white rice ($7.75) and an iced tea (soft drink $1.75).  It actually looked like the picture on the web site.  Slightly spicy on the hot side (about what I expected) but more syrupy on the sweet side than I would like.  Chains seem to like syrupy.  The servers were quick to bring dishes out without letting them sit and were keeping the tables cleaned off.Overall I think it is slightly nicer and slightly more expensive than Panda Express.  I wouldn't balk at going there again if that is what was suggested.  If in the right part of town I would prefer to go to Wok n Stix for about the same overall quality and price, and it is locally owned."
ChmqODwuYP1ewjmWXtxtsg,"After reading many decent reviews and seeing how close the restaurant was to home, I decided to give it a try.The young lady at the counter was impatient and had no interpersonal skills. The food was just not good; this place is 'Chinese take-out' at best."
pF7uRzygyZsltbmVpjIyvw,One of my students moms raved about this place so we tried it. Now their pizza is my favorite! It's sweet and a delightful change from the corporate pizza out there.
xY1sPHTA2RGVFlh5tZhs9g,"Culinary Dropout is rad. I really like this place. I've only been there once so far, but I can't wait to go back! The ambiance is crazy cool. The service was friendly and helpful. The French Dip type sandwich I ordered was melt-in-your-mouth amazing. The fries were utterly addictive (*drool). They have this Paper Bag Beer special that's pretty cool too; it's a cheap beer (PBR or another of their choice) that they'll serve to you in a paper bag (at a cheap price). Love it, haha! I also snacked on these pretzel bites that you dip in fondue cheese; those were really good too. I'm certain Culinary Dropout has 5 Star potential, so I'm really looking forward to returning."
4FS5otEktCyI1aDpg_h03g,"When I finally thought I had finished writing all of my Phoenix reviews, a notebook of even more ""To Reviews"" with dining notes resurfaces...needless to say, I think my Phoenix years went under-Yelped. Kincaid's is a surf and turf joint near Chase Field and America West Arena. I believe it's part of a large chain of restaurants of the better-than-Red-Lobster-but-not-by-much white tablecloth variety, and while the service was quick and friendly, the food was pretty bland. I do remember them having a decent selection of food for Happy Hour, but their wine list was nothing special and in the end, we ended up eating again an hour or two later. Not the best place to take vegetarians, but for those looking for a not-too-expensive (but not too great) steak before a game, I guess this is a place you could go. I, however, would recommend Durant's up central. Classic, local, and just off the light rail. :)"
aACW1qAdOfgcU8yX61dOFw,"I've been a longtime fan of Macayo's so I decided to finally write a review for them. I came here last Friday (7/29/11) for a Birthday dinner and as usual the service and food were stellar. It was really packed on Friday night yet the team still manage to efficiently serve my party of 8 as well as bring out our orders in a timely fashion. My favorites here are the Taquitos enchilada style and if you don't mind calories the Baja Chimi is delicious (one of my favorite guilty pleasures!).  Everything comes with free chips and salsa (there are two or three different salsas, make sure to ask for the spicy one if you're into heat!). Really good Happy Hour too! I haven't been to any other Macayo's location so I am only speaking on behalf of this Ahwatukee location."
SgTjnyElc26gPUghVuCuSQ,"Great food. Everything had good flavor and was brought out on time and hot. Service was great, too."
BpSLpzq_NRYghGSsb10G3A,"I have driven past this place many a time and wanted to stop in, but something always got in my way. Well, tonight was a special night and I finally got my chance to check out Tim Finnegans. As I walked through the bright red door I was hit with the authentic Irish smell of salty fish, not over powering, but just like I pulled into port. When I look around the bar I feel like I'm in an Irish antique shop, there is an old fashioned metal bike hanging on the wall with very old metal signage. It definitely has a neighborhood feel for me. This palce just gives off really good vibes to me. I would imagine that this is what an authentic Irish pub is like in Ireland.The set up of the bar is very accommodating, they have a section that is lower than the regular bar which I assume is for little people and people in wheelchairs; and any place that is considerate of all their customers earns rave reiews in my book.The LIVE music was great and a real treat. I like that they do this more than twice a week. I intereacted with two bartenders and four waitresses that night and I have to say everyone was very friendly and on the ball.I'm definitely going back. If anything changes, believe me, you'll be the first to know!"
Pr9rQKypHgC_J1AfufxzIw,"Wildflower...listen up.There are certain veggies, spices and condiments that work well in a tuna fish sandwich.For the benefit of your head chef, I'll list a few.Tuna ""Do's""MayoGreen onionCeleryJicamaHard boiled eggSweet or dill relishLemon juiceChopped bell or red pepperFresh dillLettuce (except radicchio)Olive oilCanola oilSaltPepperPurple onionCelery seedWater chestnutsTuna ""Don'ts""Mustard...coarse ground, dark yellow deli mustard!!!!Time out. DId you see mustard on my 'Do's' list? Of course you didn't and do you know why? Because no-one puts mustard on fucking tuna you idiots. What the hell are you people thinking?Your bread is delicious.

ChmqODwuYP1ewjmWXtxtsg,"The first couple of times I went to Nee House I was unimpressed.  We had ordered typical stuff off their American menu, which was okay but nothing to rave about. Then I dined there with a Chinese friend who ordered off their Chinese menu, and my opinion of Nee House did a 180 degree turn.  If you're ready to be a little adventurous, you're in for a taste treat!  I love their steamed fish, which is slathered in a delicate, flavorful broth.  The Kowloon Crab is a garlicky treat, but wear old clothes when you dig into this sticky hands-on goodie or your next stop might have to be the dry cleaners.  Other favorites are the Szechuan Green Beans and Garlic Eggplant."
Cz0McL5lUaihqOIw0_Yo7w,"The low ratings blow my mind for over easy. I thought I was a huge, picky, food snob. I have to admit, if I rated this place about 8 months ago when I first went, it would have been 3 stars due to let down. First time, I tried the over easy and had the waffle dogs for a breakfast dessert. Both of them were just meh...nothing to write home to Mom about. I decided to stop back in about 2 months later because I was driving by. Glad I did! The wolf pack with goat cheese blew my mind. Went back a few days later, country fried chicken blew my mind. Same story again for the eggs and sirloin, and jalapeno biscuits. I have yet to have something bad on the menu with the exception of the over easy and the waffle dogs. Especially considering the price and I can sit at the bar there and stare at McDowell Mountain while I eat breakfast for the same price I'd pay at a Denny's without the creepy Denny's patrons there-hard to find much to complain about here!"
XLqnjlLYt0_q_NG7l_BpMA,"Costco is always a great place to go. The only problem is you just spend so much $$ when you are there. It is sort of like a relay store as you never know what you will find. You may find just what you want , or find everything except what you came in for.People love the free samples, they are in there by the droves getting the free samples.If you go on the weekends it is torture, there are about 500 or more children running around trying to get the food samples. It is crazy!So I really prefer the week days.They are great with returns, but if you want a big item you have to figure it out how to get it home yourself.Parking is always cool and you must use cut up boxes for your purchases, so make sure to recycle, Please.They only take cash, check, or their own Credit card."
shCdCHRbnY5FTMJbWl-myQ,"Sweet baby Jesus/Krisha/Buddha, whoever! I love this place. Their approach is modern,  but the flavors are classic. I don't know how to express this, but their food tastes...clean: Fresh, bright, quality ingredients. They take pride in what they do here.I eat so much from Thai Spices, that it hurts...seriously. But I can't stop eating.Anything is good on the menu: ReallyMango Sticky Rice - A+++ (Creamy, sweet but not too sweet, with tangy mango)Lemon Fish - A (Light bright and flavorful)Pad Thai (Best I have ever had was here)I am going to stop writing since I am slowly entering a food coma.OH and remember, when ordering Medium is Thai Medium!"

Hit it up!The ladies working were really nice and the price was pretty fair.I felt like a peace pipe afterwards... no really... okay no I didn't but it was really good."
IRxBQfA7FdHhzrPjtBxuuw,"Actually, more like 3.54576745 stars.These are the same peeps in Tempe and I'm sure Chandler, and now they're in Downtown Phoenix. Thank goddess, because the pseudo-Asian hole that was in its place before was rank. I was sooo excited to see Thai Basil, with its kicking-my-boring-office-lunches-up-a-notch potential move in. Only ever having been to their Tempe location, I know at least there they had some of the better Thai I've had in AZ.Luckily, the same applies here. The food was good overall (and their Thai tea is always yum); although my barbeque chicken was a little lackluster, my colleagues had the red curry and Thai basil special and were both impressed. What wasn't impressive was the service. It seems this downtown location is still getting used to that hustle-and-bustle office lunch crowd (I think it just opened last week). We saw our server twice - once to take the order and the second to bring it - and afterwards, were on our own for extra silverware, water refills, and asking for the check. Which usually can be forgiven if the food's super good - but not so much when I'm on my lunch break and need to get back to the office pronto.They actually apologized for the service (they really did seem overwhelmed) but could've left us with a better first impression if they'd comped the drinks or given a discount.Nevertheless, I'll be back to this location, though probably for takeout. If I try them again for a sit-down and the service is improved, I'll add the 4th star. I know you're all waiting with bated breath..."
cgNIBHS2mLdbTRiodAT6EQ,"Gentrification be damed, this place is still (barely) standing. First off let me warn you that the salsa that comes with the chips is HOT. Not just a little spicy - like 5 alarm rip your own tongue out hot.That aside, the food here is really good. I usually order 3 rolled chicken tacos with gaucamole or the cheese enchiladas. They never get it wrong. Everything on the menu is cheap, fast and damn good. They are also speedy with the drink refills which always rocks.Also, you can actually catch a bus to Jaurez from their parking lot as the local scary bus to Mexico departs from the depot next door. That is pretty hot too."
zfY68t7nVihCwiCsCgM6cw,"I was awakened from my foodie revery of perfectly seasoned babaganooj on home-made bread by an eerie orgasmic humming. I looked up and saw Ken, his eyes glazed over, humming to his glass of iced Turkish coffee, a delight of his own creation. When Tony, the owner (along with his wife Juliette) came over to investigate, he decided he had to have one too.     This took place at Olive Tree Mediterranean Market and Grill in North Phoenix. Unlike most small groceries, Olive Tree is bright, clean and cheerful. The shelves are stocked with fascinating Middle Eastern delights - jars of olives and tahini, an interesting assortment of cheeses, sweet treats that I'd never seen before. You order at the counter   from a good size selection of ethnic dishes, plus a few typical American items. Food is then brought to your table in a sectioned off area.     I had discovered Olive Tree on Restaurant.com. Since we had to order $35 of food from the menu, we ended up with quite an array of dishes. Now that I think of it, the humming started with the above-mentioned baba. This roasted, pureed eggplant concoction is found in most Middle Eastern restaurants, with varying results. It can be very flat tasting if too much tahini (sesame paste) is mixed in, or it may be over-spiced. This baba was beautiful, with all the tastes dancing in our mouths. Julliette makes her own bread to go with it. The texture is very different from pita (even the pita served here was selected with great care), crustier and chewy. A special of the day was stuffed cabbage. About the same size and shape as the stuffed grape leaves (which were delicious), these are lighter and lemony good - a real treat. We shared a combination kebab plate with chicken, kefta, and shish-kebab skewers. This paled in comparison to the other dishes, since the meat was on the dry side. The baklava was quite good, it wasn't soggy with syrup, so the layers of phyllo dough made a satisfyingly crunchy noise.    After lunch we did a little shopping. We got some delicious feta cheese and something called Chicago cheese, which reminded me of mozzarella. I could have bought more, but Ken wisely herded me out the door."
7_7fxuG9ESAFmx-AiMsJHg,"From reading these previous reviews, I chose Bar Smith as the rendezvous place for my birthday.  I had never been there and I live downtown...so I wanted something close and cool.  This place looks great from the outside too.  Turns out that the experience sucked.  They list their hours online for Saturday as open 4pm-2am.  I told my party to show up at 8pm.  When we got there, they were not open and they told us that they wouldn't be open for ""a while"".  They acted like we were idiots for showing up.  It really pissed me off.  Thankfully they let me put a sign on the door directing my party next door where we waited at another lame bar.  When most of my party showed up, we bolted for Bikini Lounge.  What a bad start for a b-day night.  Two thumbs down for Bar Schmutz!"
#NAME?,"Had dinner with the wife last Thursday and wanted to try the new vegan spot in town. Very exciting that we now have 3 vegan restaurants within 10 miles of our house in Phoenix. Tediberto's seems like its still getting its feet at this point. We enjoyed ourselves and will return. Hopefully they refine things a bit more.Food: 5 Stars. Very tasty stuff for sure. Perhaps a bit over dependent on Soyrizo which makes things super spicy. The table next to us was melting under the heat of their dish and that was just a regular order. So we asked things to be as mild as possible and it could have stood to be even a bit more mild. We had the nachos, the quesadilla and La Borrachita tacos and ate everything on our plates. We finished with the tiramisu. Like I said we ate everything off our plates but the spice was a bit overwhelming.Setting: 3 stars. Very cool spot with fun lights and art. However the nightclub lighting does not help make the food look good. With the table light coming from under your plates the food its pretty much dark the whole time. I highly suggest getting more regular lighting over the tables to show off the wonderful, but spicy, food.Service: 5 stars. We had the new server help us and he was a delight. It was his second day but his enthusiasm out shined and made the dining experience that much better."

Sb1_G-DMy26YHafNxxhVrQ,"As a visitor to Scottsdale, I thought a stroll through the farmers market was a great way to get a taste of the local flavor--literally. And it was! There's a great mix of vendors, who sell everything from baked goods to coffee, from vegan wraps to preserves. There are also some interesting services like pet massages!Like Vicky T. said, it was surprising to see dogs with their owners wandering through the farmers market, because that's against code in California. But I thought it was great, and with the pet masseuse and a doggy and kitty treat vendor, it totally made sense.Farm Sessions, where local chefs give cooking demos with produce from the market, is a great idea I'd like to see at my local farmers market. It did seem odd, though, that all the produce at the market was in one corner. It was the shadiest spot, so maybe that's why?Anyway, this was a great way to spend a Saturday morning and was very relaxing compared to my local farmers markets, where I often feel like I need to start throwing some elbows to get through the crowd."
V6BYjHM9SnXscfkln3hCdA,"i knew we'd have a good time at the Orange Table after reading all the positive reviews on yelp.we visited on the first morning of our weekend trip to scottsdale.  we ordered...a mamosa - typical but always a great brunch drink.a glass or oj - extremely fresh1 plate of pancakes - can't go wrong with freshly made pancakes! the monaco - very smelly provolone so it was delicious.the white flannel - breakfast winner!!!  i've had many salty corned beef hash but theirs was seasoned perfectly!  the hatch - we were pleasantly surprised to find the chicken very moist.  the bohemian deluxe(?) - with a little sprinkle of tabasco, this dish was superb.the servers were kind and we loved the laid back decor.  we thoroughly enjoyed our breakfast and it definitely started the weekend on a positive note."
qyNtVViurIcChc35mfYIEw,"Yeah, yeah the decor is tacky and dated.  But you don't come to Touch of Thai for the sexiness of its appeal, you come here for the food.  $5.95 will get you a complete lunch of Red Curry, soup, wontons and an eggroll.  That's cheaper than Kyoto Bowl!  And yes it's delicious.  The aroma of the red curry is intoxicating, the scent of the coconut milk had my mouth watering before I'd even taken a bite. The flavor is rich and just sweet enough, with the perfect amount of spice for my taste (I ordered mild).  It could have used a few more veggies - there were only 3 green beans in my entire dish. Not the best Thai food I've ever had, but it was certainly up there.  I would definitely recommend this place for good service, quality food and cheap eats."
6Tt0mGKbMoAz1GsjkVhbMQ,"Worst burritos I've ever had, not only was the service slow but the burrito had small ingredients mixed in that weren't even supposed to be there. I got a California burrito, asked for guacamole, which they did not include and tucked into the fold of the awful tortilla was fried egg...what the hell are these people doing?The whole thing was a runny mess of beans and almost no other ingredients. The cashier was extremely rude, the meat was sub-par and I'm pretty sure the chips were radioactive. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and if you're saying this is the best Mexican place you clearly haven't been anywhere other than Del Taco or some other crap fast food chain."
z3yFuLVrmH-3RJruPEMYKw,"The food is excellent but the service is absolutely terrible. I've been going to this place for years and I'm on my forth time of telling myself to never go back due to the frustrating, slow service. Hey, I know that good food takes time to make but when I have to stand and wait for 15 minutes to get the food that I called in that I can see is just sitting on the counter well the blood pressure just gets raised too high to make the experience enjoyable. And the staff (other than the new guy that's now bringing out the food) don't seem to really care about the customers.   They hide behind the excuse that ""good food takes time"" but the hard reality is that they are just ultra inefficient and truly don't care to speed things up.  I'm sure at some point I'll cave in and return if I can't find a replacement deli but it sure would be great if they could improve the service."
cT_rocMh92B9t62Disp6gA,"This is by far the BEST Thai food you can get in Arizona.The food is amazing. I have tried several different options here including the hot and sour soup, pad Thai, coconut curry with tofu, a noodle dish with egg and basil and a tofu dish with broccoli. I have never ever been disappointed!The service is really good and quick, and the prices are right on par.We used to come here for lunch about once a week when I worked closer, and I used to make a second trip with my roommate at least twice a month.My old boss used to get a Thai Omelet... so if you are into those, you can ask for a special order!OH YEAH... I forgot, they have window service so you can actually order take out and never get out of your car! It's awesome!"
8Hn5X1AqgmSLHRG2KgBJBg,"For a local chain this is one of my favorites. OH Oregano's you make me laugh with your innuendos, your yummy thin crust pizzas, and you've had me with your pizzookies from the first time I've had one. I am grateful alone that I live in a city that has such a ridiculously wonderful and unique specialty that no other place has (that i know of)! Their pizzookies are a great alternative other than drinking if you were in a breakup, a boy passed you up (yes i'll eat my feelings if need be, and that's if a brown bag special passed me up), you failed a test, or had a shitty day.I love that their pizzookies are either choco chip white macadamia nut or oatmeal raisin. you can do half and half too! and served with two scoops of ice creams makes this an awesome snack or after dinner treat. Anywho... love it!"
3NqERLqdtQSe0w9540rZrQ,"Wow, this place is amazing. So amazing these words, ""I never want a cupcake again"" came out of my mouth after trying their Taro Milk Smoothie with Boba. It's true, I will never eat another cookie, cupcake, or piece of pie again if The Street is a viable option. The lady behind the counter was patient with our indecisive nature. She even let us sample a few items before making our final decision. We decided to split and share a smoothie since they are so large and we had just finished dinner. It was perfect, everything about it. Sucking those little balls up the straw is a real treat. I want to go back again tomorrow, and the next day, and the next. There is nothing wrong with this place except that it's so far from my house. I am willing to make the 30 minute drive again though if it means more Boba."
G4ZZHlp6CdYBZOirW2_PQA,"It should have told me something when, during prime bar time on a Saturday night the place had plenty of empty tables.It should have told me something when, those tables were empty right after a sporting event across the street at US Airways CenterIt should have told me something that those tables were empty on a Saturday night, right after a sporting event, AND it was St. Patrick's Day.HUH?  They can't even fill a downtown bar on St. Patrick's Day on a Saturday night after a sporting event next-door?Of course, if I had read the reviews here I wouldn't have tried Tilted Kilt in the first place.The first clue was when one of our group of six, a female, went to the rest room and pronounced it ""gross"".The second clue was the fact that they didn't quite get the fact that they are supposed to be an Irish pub and this was St. Patrick's Day.The third clue was how they didn't even seem to have a theme, only a very weak imitation of Hooters (I am not a fan of Hooters).Our waitress was actually pretty good.  It was easy for the 6 of us to find a vacant table and she was with us in a few minutes.  She recommended a bomb of a tiny bit of liquor and about 1/8 of a glass of beer.  No wonder she was so enthusiastic about it, they were $17 each (Tilted Kilt does NOT post prices anywhere).We had eaten at the arena so we ordered sweet potato fries.  That was the only food we had so I can't rate anything else on the menu but they were REALLY bad, something dumped out of a frozen food bag.Being a Saturday night, prime time, on St. Patrick's Day do you think there would be some entertainment?  No. Only canned music  Not even a touch of green to mark the day.  Is this place the McDonald's of Hooter lookalike bars?Here is the ultimate insult, though.  One of the drinks I ordered was a Maker's Mark Manhattan.  Now, Maker's Mark is a very premium (and expensive) brand.  Any bar in the world would serve it in a nice glass.  What did Tilted Kilt serve it in?  A tiny plastic dixie cup.  Really?  Really!!!Okay, now I see why there were so few customers and why the reviews here are so bad.  There is absolutely nothing Tilted Kilt offers to even deserve a first visit."
xmjv8g356v8Qo55ICjG8rg,"Ate there with the fam a couple of times food was good, customer service sucked! Went there SAT to try and eat dinner with my 20 yr old niece after she got out of work like 10pm and they wouldnt let us EAT there because you needed to b 21 to set foot in there. The guy in the front that asked for ID was VERY rude and because of this experience I will never set foot in there again myself or with my family. I am going to let everyone I know the horrible experience we had and not ever recommend this place to ANYONE."
mhQCxOiqp03qnhGRTtPduw,"Oh, I hesitated before we entered this what seems to be a pretty highly rated yelp restaurant...The only reason for 2 stars instead of a one  is a super friendly service.Our waiters were excellent, very helpful and accommodating. It is absolutely not their fault that food is mediocre. Actually, what was strange is that they charged our CC just the amount on the bill and did not include the tip my husband left. Bill was $26.40, my husband signed for $31, but online I see a charge of $26.40 only.  I don't know if I should call and make sure that waiters got their tip... I guess, I will do it on Monday.We ordered pho chin ( well done brisket ). The broth was good, but nothing spectacular, brisket itself was still pretty chewy and tasteless. I expected it to be at least a little bit better, but if you are hungry and want something hot, go for it. The portion is very generous.Vegetable Cha Gio (Fried Vietnamese egg rolls) was completely soaked in some oil, which totally ruined the dish. It looked like their fryer was not hot enough when they dipped rolls for cooking. Another possibility is that oil was old. Neither of the scenarios excites me.Vermicelli with seasoned grilled shrimps disappointed as well. There were only 5 tiny shrimps on the top, pretty rubbery but tasty. The rest seemed to be 2 pounds of vermicelli.I don't know what everyone else with 5 star reviews ate there, but whatever we had was not that. I don't mind cheap, ethnic food, and I know that it can be inexpensive but still very good. I will not repeat, but I encourage you to try. Maybe, it was a bad day and you will get something better. Again, the service is very friendly, I kind of feel bad leaving such a negative review, but I cannot lie and led other people believe that the food was good."
10BgGvCMDH-JbYsg8KRLRg,"As far as chill coffee shops go, three roots is at the top of my list. It has a very laid back atmosphere. There is always pretty good music playing and cool local artwork featured. I like the mix of different tables, couches and chairs that gives the place a cozy vibe. It can get a little crowded there and is not always the best place for quiet studying but  is a nice place to hang out with friends. They even have a few board games. I am not a big coffee drinker but they do have a good assortment of teas, and I especially like their chai. I have also tried the veggie burger which was pretty good. Overall if you are looking for a cute coffee shop to hang out at I definitely recommend three roots."
8o-NLKy_XfbJtqljX9XLCA,"First off I would like to punch the dip Shit on the food network who said this was the best chicken he ever ate. Yeah the place is filthy, but how they operate their business is redicolus. Service sucks, 49 minute wait for the food sucks, waiting 20 minutes from the first  entree being dropped off until the last person luckily receives their food sucks, being told on the 59th minute of a hour wait for your food, that they are out of your side dishes, sucks, spending my hard earned money at a place that is Ass backwards in any kind of business sense, sucks. At first our group thought it was a joke, then the reverse racism theory was brought up, then we noticed that every table was experiencing the same lack of service. Black, white, purple,orange. They just sucked."
xEg0-xrQywU5K-WQO7cy0w,"We just moved to Phoenix from Colorado. In Boulder there are tons of Indian food and Nepali places to choose from and my family is also Nepali, so when it comes to that style of food, I know what I am looking for.So when my husband and I were in the mood for some home-cooked food (we dont have a kitchen yet) we yelped up the best restaurant and drove about 45 minutes to get there. When we got to Indian Paradise it was just after 5 so we were the first ones in there. We ordered daal, chicken tikka masala, chicken curry, garlic naan and vegetable samosas.  We are always wary of trying new places for Indian cuisine because we are soo often disappointed, but this restaurant was a very pleasant surprise. It was really very delicious. Some of the best chicken tikka I have ever had. I ordered mine at medium spice but I probably could have had it more spicy. I also tried the chicken curry that the hubby ordered and it was very delicious!! We were very very pleased with the food over-all and will most definitely go back even though it was more expensive.The staff was also very nice. We told (I'm assuming) the owner that we were new and we found this place on yelp and he was very happy about that. We asked of some places to go with some hindu culture and he graciously gave us some ideas. He also gave us his card and told us to call if we needed help finding anything culture based. The only down side was that I DID get some dirty looks from a woman who pulled up in a yellow corvette. I'm assuming she just is not very well cultured. We eat Indian food with our hands because that is how it is meant to be eaten. I swear it tastes better that way! Ask anyone from India or Nepal and I guarantee you they do eat with their hands and will show you the technique. So when we had been craving some home cooked food I decided I was going to eat it how it tasted best. The dirty looks were well worth it though because the food was SOOOOOO good. Completely satisfying. I am very very glad that we made the drive up there (we live all the way at baseline and central). The left-overs the next day were awesome! We will definitely be back."
LYyGQgL60VKdV-p_9OxmWQ,"This was the worst experience ever in a restaurant!First, the service was lackadaisical at best.  It was very slow to have our order taken, and it took almost 40 minutes from the time we ordered to get our food. The food itself was tasty enough, once it finally arrived.However, the worst part about this meal was the COCKROACH that we discovered on the wall over our table.  Immediately, my friend and I began to point at it and talk loudly. We tried to get the attention of waitstaff for several minutes.  Finally, the cockroach fell onto our table. That was it. We leapt out of the booth and exclaimed ""COCKROACH!"" Is this the worst part of the visit?  NO.  Waitstaff then came over, pulled back the table, squashed the cockroach, and then gestured for us to resume our meal and said ""Cockroach gone."" At least the manager comped the meal.  But,  if there is one cockroach allowed to crawl around the dining room TABLES, I can only imagine what the kitchen might look like. I definitely can't imagine going back!"
HMUvbAHRnbAczNrYy8e5MA,"Good sandwiches... I'm a fan of the Midwest Best and the White Widow. Been going here for a long time and anyone looking at reviews trying to decide... Just go and give it a shot man! it's a fun experience and the food is good, everyone is going there... No peer pressure!!! :)They should have one of these in every campus town!"
LzpR_jE6VIutJ08s2cdRrw,"Third time back.  This is my 9 year old daughter's favorite restaurant for special celebrations.  Maybe because the portions are sized for her.  Just kidding.  Sort of.Always good food.  Sometimes terrific.  But never consistently, hit the ball out of the park good.  The bill creeps up on you.  We can't ever seem to walk out the door with less than $80-120 bill for 2-3.  Last night, had the filet.  At maybe 5 ournces, bigger and more substantial than the last time, when I think I paid $32 for 2 ounces.  Seriously.Last time the steak was perfect.  This time, they overcooked it, but I didn't have the heart to send it back.  So my wife ate it and enjoyed it, and I got her salmon.Salmon was just okay.  BUT, the bed of rissoto, one of my favorite dishes, was delightfully rich and creamy.Overall, it's not a terrible value.  And it's a cute little french restaurant.  COMPLETELY and totally not appropriate for small children, so don't even try.  Great date place.Whatever you do, you MUST try two things:  1) Onion Tart - it's just a slice and a side salad as an appetizer, but OH what a slice.2) Berry Tart - the deserts are what makes this place go.  Save room.  Remember this:IF YOU GO TO A RESTAURANT WITH TART IN ITS NAME, AND DON'T ORDER A TART... well, what can I say.  Just don't do it.Will be back, as I always have, and will promise to only feel slightly mugged next time I pay the bill."
7tTK3VPlFtBGBHm8-LZIUg,"Bopped in here for the the 'Monday Night Special': flatbread and a bottle of wine for $19! Yay deal!We enjoyed the pancetta and asparagus flatbread, with caramelized onions added. Scrumptious! We also ordered the tamarind drumettes with sweet chili sauce. The place was hopping and our seats at the bar provided a cozy perch to people watch and enjoy our munchies. You know when you first meet someone and it may be too early to tell, but you think it could really be something special? That's how I'm feeling about Timo. I hope it's love."
ImVx220_Pcp2iB5uworODw,"The stuffed bell pepper looked good, but I had to send it back twice to get it hot (which seems to be a theme for this restaurant) got it steamy and then had to use the seasonings at the table to make it tasty. This restaurant is busy due to default. It's convenient to the movie, reasonable priced and quick. Their lack of flavor and heat is standard. I wish they'd get a little heavier handed with the garlic & oregano. A garlic knot should clearly taste garlicky! Their house salad is a good deal and if you stick to a slice of pizza it's okay.They have done some work on the interior that is an improvement and looks nice."
JOZqBKIOB8WEBAWm7v1JFA,"Been working on filling up my frequent customer card at Acacia Cafe, still in love with the little place. Turns out Sunday's are special because they've got a few extra menu items for their Sunday Brunch, including an awesome Fruit & Nut Waffle, with cranberries, raisins and walnuts baked right in. Yum. Other Sunday specials include Eggs Benedict and Eggs Albuquerque. If you've never been to Acacia on a Sunday, check it out."
oyzxIqrtzu-8sWlPhJVsLw,"I was reasonably happy with the food here.  Ordered a beef chimichanga with rice and an extra tortilla on the side.  The chimi was just a little dry, with lightly seasoned shredded beef - probably could have used a little more of a kick, but it was ok.  Rice is rice - nothing out of the ordinary there.  The tortilla was piping hot, and was pretty good.  I don't know if it's really the best tortilla in Phoenix like they say, but I wasn't disappointed with it - just a little chewy and had a nice flavor.Including a drink and tax, it came to about $8.50, which was about right.  Overall, not something I'd go out of my way for, but I think I'd go back if the opportunity arises.  Plus you can get fresh tortillas to go for a good price, so I may just do that next time I'm cooking at home, instead of getting store-bought."
gkv2XvXpFgiq4Bb2XK7YmQ,"I'm apparently at the opposite end of the spectrum from Brook R since this is probably the nicest Hard Rock Cafe I've ever experienced. First off, it's large. And all that really means is more room for novelty rock items which is fine by me. I'm a sucker for guitars. I stay away from Guitar Center on purpose, and that purpose is to not jeopardize paying rent on time. If I'm ever rich someday, I'll buy guitars just to hang on my walls like some would hang paintings. Of course I'll purchase an equal amount to actually play but that's beside the point. They're gorgeous AND my favorite wall covering.We had the most insane server ever - a lady by the name of Barbi. Just... wow. It was safe to say that Barbi had 'seen some shit' in her lifetime. I sensed a background as a stripper maybe, or a lot lizard at a truck stop, PLENTY of sun ...and who knows what else. In any case, she was awesome. Attentive, funny, sat with us, made jokes, talked shit on our regional manager right in front of him (it was a work trip) and even scored us some shot glasses that I'm not sure if we were charged for or not. If we weren't however, the tip we left more than made up for it.The dining experience combined with the ABUNDANCE of gorgeous women (there's something in the water) perusing the streets after the Sun's game let out across the street took the strain off work travel and made for my favorite evening thus far within Arizona borders."
It8Q9-l1EEtTr9NPpTgGPA,"Wow wow wow! I never thought I would find an arepa place in Mesa, AZ! This place delivers quality food with great service. The owner himself sat us at our table and offered to explain the menu. He even made suggestions for what to eat. I have only had Venezuelan food in California, but this place did not let me down. I went during a weird hour so the restaurant was empty. This allowed for prompt service and more attention. The arepas were made fresh and come either baked or fried. I went with the baked option and was thoroughly impressed. The sauces are delicious so don't pass those up (especially the green creamy sauce and the white garlic sauce). I also had an empanada, which was delicious too! I would highly recommend coming here...it is a good alternative to the standard Mexican fare that is offered all over AZ."
HMUvbAHRnbAczNrYy8e5MA,"Damn stoners forgot to make my food!!! How could you do this to me Cheba Hut?? I've loved you for 9 years! I understand the argument of not being allowed to watch the flatscreen TV during work hours is an important one, but being that apparently talking to each other is too big of a distraction to not miss orders, I'm gonna have to side with management on this one.Aside from the literal temper tantrum I witnessed by the majority of the staff with regard to the aforementioned TV, screaming obscenities and all, everything else was pretty crappy too. I got a salad for the first time ever at Cheba Hut, specifically the Southwestern Chicken Salad, and boy oh boy was that a mistake!! After waiting 20+ minutes for my shitty salad, I am handed a bowl full of brown-edged lettuce with mayonnaise-based chicken salad looking suspiciously like it came out of a can scooped on top.  Nowhere did I see the spicy marinated chicken breast, salsa, and other southwestern accoutrement I was promised by the description.The manager/owner/person of authority came out at the last second to earn this second star by giving me a free rice krispie treat for my troubles, which was freakin' delicious.This broke my heart Cheba Hut, as I pretty much survived only on your Dank Nugs and Kind Pinners through college, but you did me wrong today. Get your shit together, get some fresh (preferably local) vegetables, and get the whiny, pre-pubescent boys out from behind the counter and I'll consider coming back.Until then, thanks to the god awful salad and non-service, you guys are cashed."
St3jS0PnF1lulH1ggA4Jgw,"This is my first ever YELP so be patient.  I was just thinking that I am sick and tired of using ""starbucks"" as my office away from office and I wanted to find a new place that has access to a patio or some kind of fresh air, internet, and a nice environment to work in. Well...By George I think I found it!  Luci's is a mix of a vegan/organic market along with a coffee shop.  It has a giant garage door (think Postino) that is open today due to the nice weather and a full selection of coffee and other type quick bites and pastries.I settled into a nice couch space by a window and am working away on the FREE WiFi sipping one of the best tasting coffee drinks in town and muching on a organic food bar.Overall, the place feels good and is comfortable enough top come for a casual coffe and read the paper or hit the office work in a better environment.  Plenty of light to do work and also not too crowded so you can have a conversation on the phone or in person.The only thing left to be desired is the ""barista"" wasn't the fastest man on the planet...but this is Phoenix and its more about quality than fast service here."
VO13q-11lh7St1gd7JPI3Q,"Yesterday we were exploring the downtown Scottsdale area and decided to eat here. I've been to the one in Chicago and knew that the food would be at the very least average. We each ordered the Bento Box lunch. I was blown away!!!! We got the onion soup, mixed green salad, grilled asparagus and grilled salmon on a bed of mashed potatoes. Everything was delicious and the perfect amount of food."
ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A,"Oregano's is home to the Great Dessert War of '02. The skirmish began when the then named Bazookie was placed on the dinner table. The Bazookie as describe by the menu is ""a 1/2 pound of Chocolate Chip dough, slightly baked in a 6-inch pizza pan then topped with 3 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream."" Things started out with the appropriate amount of consideration for the other diner til the first bite was consumed. A fire was noticed in each others eye. Utensils soon became weapons. Ground was won and lost. The battleground was a deep dish pizza pie pan that was spun numerous times in order to gain advantage for the best and perfect bite. Spoon fulls of warm cookie dough were knocked down back onto the table to be taken away... It turned ugly quick. No offers of sharing or giving the last bite. It was fought for tooth and nail. The dessert was THAT GOOD. I would go back to Phoenix for this dish alone. And the pizza? It is a pizza joint, but that's not what we talk about or remember. The pizza was good, but not on the level of the dessert. Freshly baked chocolate chip cookie dough and vanilla ice cream!!!! What more do you people need???"
sZAzeccYUVPjlkrlMooV-g,"like every other reviewer here, i've been meaning to try this place out for a little while. its located behind the blockbuster i go to, so its pretty hidden, unless your in that plaza for any reason. the place is decorated in a relaxed, lunchtime style. nice tables and some cool ethnic decor to catch your eye. the man who was working (i didn't catch his name) was very friendly. he asked if i had ever tried Philippine food before. and then proceeded to show me show me of their dishes. i settle on their pork burrito and garlic fried rice. the burrito was amazing! the meat was so flavorful and the tortilla was crispy and greasy at the same time. the chips that came with my meal were a little stale, but i just ignored them and had at the amazing garlic rice. not to greasy (any more grease after that burrito would have been to much) but big on taste. i loved my meal, and i will be heading that way for lunch regularly."
8t80-omyflkywRfu9LPh6g,"Five stars, all the way. Five star staff... our server was incredibly attentive and accomodating, which is wonderful when you make the fantastically inappropriate decision to dine at a seafood restaurant with a vegetarian and a person who hates fish. She made sure we were not just happy, but ecstatic with our wine choices by bringing over various tastes from their lengthy wines by the glass list. They graciously serve oysters (two different kinds) in any denomination, so if you're craving 'em but don't want to order a bunch (or if you really want someone to try them... and you should, the blue tips were A-MAZ-ING), you don't have to... you can just get one.The cashew calamari was impressively tender, and no having to deal with the little baby squid guys with their tentacles and so on. It's all fresh and fileted length-wise, then battered and fried. Delish.The servers all wear white jackets (it's an appreciated touch) and mill about quickly and efficiently. The place is so large that you sometimes forget that the other side of the wine cellar boasts a rather bustling bar. The chairs are wonderfully comfortable. The lights are high, like the designers were exalting the space and celebrating the high ceilings. The experiential fountain pillars out front are disarming, as are the textured French doors. The whale bone-esque structure over the bar is a clever design element, feeding the eastern thought that restaurants are, indeed, where you enter the belly so as to feed the belly.I will be back here again and again."
EGiGWZp_zSqdeftiFQ7MbA,"From the outside the place looked alot busier however, Not a bad place to go for lunch on Friday afternoon. Especially when it's close to 1pm as the place was pretty empty. My coworker order brisket tacos and they came out stuffed with tons of brisket. She said they they were very good and I will take her word for it as they looked pretty tasty. Now me, I am not an enchilada person however the enchilada de avocado sounded pretty good as it had two of my favorites stuffed in in, avocado and artichoke. I must admit that it was pretty good. I only finished a little bit of it as I had filled up on the warm chips and salsa that was served when we sat down. Yum. So why only three stars? Well It's actually 3.5 stars as although the food and the company were great, the service was a little off. Like I said the place was empty and yet our server either forgot about us at times or was busy doing something else in the back. Nicole, our server was sweet enough but still.... hmmm. Oh well no biggie. It was empty and we did get in and out in under an hour but not 5 star worthy. Will I be back again? Probably as the food was pretty good. Heck the chips and salsa alone are worth giving it another shot."
_tkAI5Q5XQSfgbqJzDKSDQ,"2 people $70+ for $12.00 worth of food given the quality.  (and $12 is pushing it)The patio is very nice and I think would be both fun and fine for drinks, chips, guacamole, and salsa.  The Salsa is quite good.  If your planning to eat, go elsewhere!However, that's about where it ends from our experience.  Tortilla factory's food didn't rate on par with even some of the taco carts around town (some of which are actually quite good, so it's probably in insult to the carts to compare them with this place).  We ordered the mole ribs.  The mole was not traditional and was very bad; ribs were dried out and cold.  I think maybe they made the mole early in the day, and then held it around.  The taste was sour, burnt, and harsh.  Not the subtle spice and flavor of a good mole.We then went on to have several main dishes.. one of which was the green pork Chile Verde.  The presentation was awful and the dish looked washed out and very bad.   Think Alpo.   The flavors of the sauce as good but, the meat was dry and tough.The other dish we had was a sweet honey steak dish.  The flavor was fair, presentation was decent however.Overall, I'd have to say I felt sorry for the servers and anyone going here thinking that they are getting a taste of local fare.   Sadly, the food is a very poor representation of the city and its diverse southwestern/Mexican culture.This restaurant has such potential due to its location, but, it's time to change out the chef or get a restaurant consultant in and refresh the menu for it ever to be taken seriously for anything but drinks on the patio.   If you want good southwestern fusion fair in old town Scottsdale, try ""The Mission"" on the other side of Scottsdale road and just a couple blocks south or Barrio Cafe in central Phoenix."
2mcmuAvpNIJuV3gV0v9v2A,"Solid 3.5 stars. A wee bit under the weather, I looked to Marian to cook something nourishing and chase the monster in my head. So she took me here. Great idea.I had eaten here before, but it had been quite some time. Spring rolls were tasty with a delightful peanut dipping sauce. Loaded with vermicelli, shrimp and what I think was turkey. I noticed after ordering these that they had chicken wings in a special fish sauce scrawled on the chalkboard. Yes please. Crispy hot and coated in a savory salty sweet fish sauce with bits of caramelized shallot, really tasty. Bowls of soup chock full of noodles and mixed proteins. Tripe, tendon, meatball, beef. I thought the depth of flavor in the broth was minimal, but after augmenting with fish and chile sauces, basil and whatnot it was quite tasty. Just what the doctor ordered.Washed it all down with an icy mug of 33 beer, I was feeling 100 % better. I love it when she cooks like this."
qsWxbgQwuomXvMseg23DGg,"I'm pissed. How can you just stop making grilled cheese? Its bread and cheese. HOW? You have bread, and you have cheese, but you cannot make a grilled cheese?Also, why does it have to be 400 degrees? I know you have A.C. This is AZ in the summer. It's hot. Turn it on.I don't have a really good basis to draw this conclusion because I rarely order this drink, but your dirty vodka martini is quite possibly the worst I have ever tasted. I had to eat a cheese stick with each bite just to stomach it.Your tater tots were good and my blue moon was reasonably priced. At least you have that going for you."
qkbloHdDZuHf_0wTqUGPjQ,"My wife and I went here for happy hour last night.  If you stick to the happy hour menu then its a pretty good deal.  I should have listened to my own advice because after having a way-too-sweet happy hour Prickly Peartini I decided I needed a ""big boy"" drink and ordered a regular martini.  While the regular martini was decent, I should have stuck to the Prickly because $17 was outrageous for the size they give you.  My wife made the same mistake and ordered a $15 glass of wine instead of their ""house"" wine which would have been $5.  Needless to say we learned our lesson when it comes to drinks at this place.  We were a bit smarter about the food.We shared a ""Savory Nibbles"" platter which is a selection of 4 very small....nibbles.  We shared the deviled egg, meatloaf slider, grilled cheese and the shrimp and manchego flat.  It was all excellent and I could have eaten an entire plate full of any one of those things.  Be warned that they are only a very small taste and only enough for one bite each if you are sharing with another person.  Anyway its not bad for $5 during happy hour.  There are 3 or so other selections that looked good as well.3 or so of their other appetizers are 1/2 off during happy hour so we ordered the Charred Chicken Lollipops.  You get a decent portion of small chicken drumstick things in some tasty sauce.  They are NOT fried and weren't drowned in sauce.  Anyway, these were excellent and I would definitely order them again. Like most decent happy hours in the valley, this one was quite typical in terms of service.  The bar area gets a bit crowded and it takes forever to get a drink and food.  It is not really the waiters' fault because they are going almost as fast as they can.  The problem is that there aren't enough of them so they are stuck serving way to many tables."
DxUn-ukNL27GOuwjnFGFKA,"So, we decided to come here because of the reviews and well, I wasn't very impressed, especially after such a long drive. I was content with the sashimi and happy that they didn't charge extra when they served extra hamachi, but was a little irritated with the rolls. The cucumber rolls were dry, and the spicy tuna and spicy yellowtail rolls were mediocre at best. Overall, the quality of their sashimi was good, but you'll have to pay for it. A little to over priced for what we ordered. Probably won't be making a second trip here unless we are in the area."
c1yGkETheht_1vjda7G5sA,"I've eaten a huge percentage of the food on Green's menu and I love it all. If nothing else, come here to try the Soynami's (vegan Blizzards). I'm not a fan of rice or soy ice cream but this stuff is amazingly good.The bowl meals are packed with great fresh vegetables. I mostly eat whole foods and don't consider the fake meats to be especially healthful, but I love to eat the fake meat here once in a while for the texture. It's so good. It's not exactly like the real thing, but it doesn't need to be. It's delicious as it is. There is always a huge variety of people eating here all the time. It's always packed, always hard to get a table. Good for Green Restaurant!Atmosphere: The restaurant is made with green materials. Every time we go they are showing the work of a different artist. It's college-indie and casual.The employees don't act super enthusiastic, but they're decent and polite and do a good job. I love the humor of whoever it is that writes up the food specials on the chalkboard. BTW, you can get vegan whipped cream here and it's SO GOOD!   :)"
pzPbg_B2uSVJ72LIa2G3sA,"I went to Genghis Grill one evening while the Beijing Olympics were being aired. My experience eating here was probably a lot like Shawn Johnson's experience at the games -- not quite the showing I expected, but GG still managed to eek out a medal or two.My favorite Mongolian places include soup and salad bars in addition to the ingredients to be grilled; Genghis Grill does not. I missed being able to snack on a salad while waiting on my first bowl. The ingredients were all fine; most seemed fresh, but I had to avoid a couple of the less popular offereings (for the life of me, I don't understand why bok choy hasn't captured the hearts of the American public). The sauces were generally tasty...think Trader Joe's bottled dressings and you'll get the idea. The highlight of the night was when I realized the shredded cheese that given to me by request came free and clear. Of course, this made me wish I would have asked for sour cream, too. You won't see a picture of my experience at the Genghis Grill on a Wheaties box any time soon, but the meal was pleasant enough for a solid three stars."
roTWGaU-RcJ06l8cjFw7xQ,"I admit, I am not a mexican food coniseur, but I have a taste for it every now and then.  Being that I've never eaten at a Macayo's before, I thought I would give it a shot this time, and sit down and eat here at this location.On the good side, the place is very colorfully decorated....lots of bright colors, and plenty of decor to match.  The service was wonderful, and I enjoyed myself while I was here.The down side, is that I found the food a bit pricy, and I wasn't all that impressed.  I ordered 2 tacos and a cup of tortilla chicken soup.  The cup was rather tiny, and was a bit disappointed with the small portion.  It was good, but a bit spicy for my taste.  The tacos were good, but honestly, Ive gotten bigger, better tasting tacos from Filbertos at half the price.I could see myself coming here more as a happy hour guest, or bringing some out of town friends here to enjoy the decor and get a taste for some of thier food, but not as a regular customer.  I don't think its bad, I just feel that the food was just okay and it was a bit overpriced for what I felt like I got."
I4bSn5gXsHuSPu7L-d_8nQ,"A couple friends and I came here during AZ Eats. It was a chance for us to get venture to something outside of our norm (Postino's or Switch). We made reservations and showed up right on time. The place was packed and we wound up waiting for about an hour before we got a table, but we got to sit at the bar and enjoy some great wine.We each tried sometihng different and everything was great! Unique flavors, great presentation, great staff. We had a really wonderful dinner! My favorite part? The s'mores with bacon and peanut butter mouse. A-MAZ-ING"
IPsG_71MD8pwB9i3TKOJYg,"Had a great lunch here with my friends Sherry and Brandon. The two owners (I am guessing here, but father and son?) were very friendly and attentive. I had the baba ganouj pita with lettuce and tomato, and everyone else's food looked great (a chicken pita sandwhich and amazing looking lentil soup). I was throroughly entertained by a middle eastern television show (satellite I guess?), and the great mix of locals and business people. The market section is also great- you'll find loads of bottled cooking oils, spices, pickles and other pickled veggies, canned eggplant, cous cous and pastas, as well a fridge section with nice looking prepared foods. Will definitely return!"
qW9UysjJw3y3CwEbzruEEw,"What's going on with the food here? Is there new owners? The food seems to be getting less tasty each time I come here. The beef for the green burrito is not the same, the cheese (white) is horriible. Taste like cafeteria or hospital food. I hope the owner didn't sell and now some cheap owner are buying food now. I used to give this place a 5 star and now I would have to grade them as a 1 star until they improve the quality of there food."
e8FMAuTswDueAlLsNyLhcA,"Extremely disappointed in this restaurant. Solely came here based on the reviews which all fell short. The hangover sandwich did not have a full egg on it and when I requested avocado I was only giventwo slices on one side. I ended up just eating a avocado and bacon sandwich due to the lack of ingredients. As for my ""double mimosa"" it came in the smallest glass with the weakest contents of champaign. Yet another let down was the horrible service by our waitress. She failed to bring out water or check on us consistently but paid little attention or our requests. I have had better customer service in McDonalds drive thru to say the least. This place will not be getting my service again."
_qTzOkbin2giDOrFsaxm8A,"A fellow yelper told me about this place, and I finally made it there a week or so ago. Since then, I can't seem to stay away- Sunday's venture was the third time in two weeks. What can I say? I like it. It's cheap, it's tasty, and it's fresh. No, you won't find the best middle eastern food in the world at Al-Hana, but you can't go wrong with a $3.99 chicken shwarma sandwich. The baba ghanoush is perfectly smoky, the hummus is ok. The chicken shwarma sandwich was really good, the falafel- not so much. Try the spinach pies. Maybe spinach isn't the first ingredient you'd like to find in a pie, but these will change your mind. Don't bother coming here if you're looking for a fancy sit down meal. It's completely no-frills, but completely tasty. One great thing to know about this place: They open at 9 am every day. Taboulleh for breakfast? Sure, why not?"
vtQOervVVTXjhvSZQiZ6PA,"Overall I enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere here, but they fell short of 4 stars for me.We were served in somewhat of a tag-team style, there were probably 3-4 different people waiting on us.  I thought that was a bit unusual.  The staff was friendly if a bit aloof.  We did have a spill at our table (yes it was me again, but no drinking was involved this time) which they could have handled better.We had Pad Thai and an appetizer sampler-I forget what that was called.  The Pad Thai was heavily flavored and the sauce was kind of heavy.  I prefer a lighter sauce for the Pad Thai-it should not be a heavy dish like Alfredo.  The apps were good, particularly the Satay.  The Spring Rolls were overly oily.I consider the prices here to be a bit high for Thai food as I've had so much great Thai food for very reasonable prices.  If I'm paying 12 bucks for a noodle dish it had better be excellent, not just good."
-9pVS__IliMA2aNEYzrQrg,"Hate is a strong word, but I genuinely dislike this place.  I'm not exactly sure why.  Maybe a rundown of my Junkie experience will help me figure it out.The line was ridiculously long for a place that seemed like just a bar and not a nightclub.  I wasn't in the mood to wait in line, so my friend pulled one of his sneaky moves that gets us in every time... working in television has it's perks.  Once inside, I felt confused and at odds with my surroundings.  The music made it too loud to talk, but there was no place to dance.  The place was packed and getting up to the bar proved challenging.  I gave my friend a desperate 'I need a drink asap because I already hate this place' look and together we muscled our way to the counter.  After we got our drinks, my friend and I wondered aimlessly around the place and we just couldn't settle on a comfortable spot to chill.  We finished our drinks and left.Sounds fun, I know.I just didn't feel the place at all.  The people were not my kind of people.  The girls all looked the same.  I can't stand when a bunch of girlfriends look like each other, not everyone needs to have the same stupid hairdo.  There was something off about the guys too.  I did not find even one remotely attractive.  They all seemed either oily, overly metro-sexual, or inflated with a false sense of self.  I did give it another shot on a Thursday night and ended up leaving before my friends again.  Mostly because I actually have a real job that requires my brain to start functioning by 8:30, but also because I just wasn't feeling it.After typing my lame experience and thus reliving it, I still can't figure out exactly why I can't have a good time at American Junkie.  I just can't and I really should not need to try that hard, right?If I end up going back and having a good time, I will let you know.  Just don't hold your breath."
Vx7-xbazum3dgo3Qj3i4pQ,"""Yummy, & big-plate Mexican food in Scottsdale!"" 4/5La Fonda has been one of our favorite restaurants for the last 2 years. We love going there to get some house margaritas with one or two plates of soul, comfort Mexican food. My favorite is its Shrimp Fajitas hot plate. J always like their Combo dish. Remember to pour some spicy salsa sauce on your food if you like hot stuff! :) We love the place and would recommend all our friends to try it out!"
ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,"Holy overpriced!  With everyone all abuzz about this place opening up in AZ, I figured we would have to give it a try sometime.  Well, we were out and about in the EV this weekend and figured now was as good as ever.  Things did not start off well.  First, the music was so LOUD!  Some poor old lady walked in and covered her ears the second the door opened.  I also hated the peanut shells.  It was stupid, poorly executed and had no business being in a fast food burger joint.  Steakhouse or BBQ place, maybe, but not here.  Apparently the ordering system is difficult because it took the 6 or so people in front of us forever to order, but for us smart folk, it takes about 30 seconds.Now to the food.  It costs 4.89 for a single patty bacon cheeseburger.  I can get a Baconator combo at Wendy's for that price.  That's just the burger here, so for an extra 2.59 I can get frys (a generous portion at least) and another couple bucks gets me a drink.  I'm practically pushing a 10 dollar combo here!  This is fast food right?  I couldn't help but compare it to In'N'Out and this place was failing miserably!  Our food came out in roughly 5-8 minutes and we went outside to eat because the music was unbearably loud.  The frys were decent, nothing to special and I found the cajun fries to be very dry feeling in my mouth.  The burger was such a disappointment.  It was small and very smashed when I opened it.  The meat was very well done, and not juicy like they said it should be.  The bacon was decent and the cheese was well, cheese.  Overall, a pretty lame burger, especially for nearly 5 bucks!Obviously, I was disappointed.  I know 5 bucks for a burger isn't a lot, but for fast food, it really is.  It's a shame that our President hasn't had the joy of experiencing decent burgers, because this place is not good.  This place is definitely a fail for me, but at least my food was edible."
jEkaxdgLxUCf4jtUnCPVWg,"What a great idea - self serve frozen yogurt!A lot of flavors and even more toppings - yummy!I think there is a lot to be said for making this yourself - its almost like being at home making your own dessert. I had the Dolce de Leche yogurt with chocolate sauce, oreos and choc chips - no one can say that's a bad combination....because I made it for myself - I think that's the magic here."
erBoatMp1TFi_NPxTigp6w,"No one seems to like this place and now I know why. Maybe I'm giving it 2 stars because I'm a fan of their sangria. The chicken tacos are standard. My sis had the chicken skewers appetizer and said they were pretty dry.  I was there for happy hour on a Friday night and it was pretty quiet. Our bartender was nice but not super friendly. Um, I think that was my last visit to Pink Taco."
AhpzPZH3b0PGT9mVoLCQDg,"Yelpers prove to be right yet again with the average 3 stars on this one... I was craving sushi and had a hot date with my sister-in-law last night to do dinner and a movie... It just so happened that Eat Pray Love was playing at the Tempe Marketplace Harkins Theater, so we decided to meet at Kabuki before the movie.  I walked in first and asked how long the wait was for two... I as told 10 or 15 minutes.  Not so bad... so I decided to wait.  I walked outside and met up with my Alexa and we came back in about ten minutes later... As we did so, two other women came in and I saw that they were seated right away.  I looked at Alexa, looked up at the hostess stand, was thinking (WTF), and then went and asked nicely where we were on the list.  ""There are two tables before you,"" I was told.  ""It will likely be another ten minutes or so."" At that, I responded, ""is there another option, perhaps sushi bar, that I don't know about?""And alas, there sure was... (they neglected to give me that option when I originally checked-in).  We were seated at the sushi bar at that moment and went on to have a very underwhelming meal.  Here's why:-While the large portion cucumber salads we ordered were extremely tasty, the cucumbers were cut lengthwise in such a way that it was difficult to eat.  I prefer cucumbers diced in smaller pieces so they are easier to eat!-Service - our waiter wasn't the friendliest... I felt kind of rushed by him when we were there.  Additionally, since we were seated in the middle of the sushi bar, all of the wait staff would reach over us to pick up the sushi for their tables, which was very distracting while we were eating!  Perhaps they could've moved the sushi ready for pick-up to the side of the sushi bar to avoid distracting guests in the future?-The sushi itself was good; not amazing.  We had a Sunset roll, a Lotus roll, a Large roll, and an order of Ikura.  I didn't realize the Lotus roll was going to have a ton of mayo along with the baked Lobster that came on top of it... it was a bit on the creamy side for my liking.-To top things off, when the bill came, they overcharged us... a simple mistake, but given our experience, it was just one more negative thing... and then when I pointed it out, I barely got an apology at all.With so many other restaurants to choose from in the Tempe Marketplace, I am not sure I'll return to Kabuki.  If I do, however, I will wait for a regular table!"

TuuENwzxOFdDLY_oKCbFZw,"Haven't been here in a while but was treated to lunch yesterday by my boss! I ordered the half Cuban Sandwich, with a side of red, ripe tomatoes, fresh mozzarella salad. Yum! It was outstanding! The sandwich was too large to fit in my mouth so I had to cut it up with a knife and fork. The pork was tender, juicy and delicious - and was bought from the local Pork Shop here in Queen Creek. For desert I ordered the warm lava cake with a side of homemade vanilla ice cream and whisky sauce. Oh my! I think I am hungry again! My boss is a Southern gal who knows that good food = good teamwork. I hope she doesn't think I was a pig! Next time, lunch will be on me. Oink Oink!!"
xMK01ZbVUYLLoyqoeWAIVw,"I love, love, love the Keg!  I've been to this location as well as San Tan Village, Tempe Marketplace and Desert Ridge and have had nothing but exceptional food and service. I really like the atmosphere, it has that dark, cozy steakhouse feeling without being too stuffy or pretentious.  We enjoyed an excellent  Halloween dinner here last night which included a ""Keg sized"" glass of Fetzer chardonnay, a margarita (very strong), the Keg Classic Dinner (ceasar salad, 7 oz filet wrapped in bacon, mixed vegetables and a loaded baked potato), bacon wrapped scallops (an appetizer that I ordered for my entree) and their fabulous bread with whipped butter, YUM!  Our server was very outgoing and friendly and offered suggestions as far as the menu.  The bill with tax and tip was $68, really an excellent value. Overall, a great meal and dining experience.  I will definitely be back and can't wait!"
yktWUtKBja_Lzk3wwR6RFA,"I really adore this place. They've got some of the best lentil soup around and all of their chicken dishes have been perfectly seasoned and very, very juicy. I recently got the kabob plate and it came out so tender and juicy it was falling apart on my fork. Their hummus and garlic sauce are both very good as well and the service is quick and friendly. Last time I was in, I noticed they expanded their dining section so the place is a bit bigger now, probably to accommodate the increase in customers from the park-and-ride light rail station right in front of their restaurant.Do yourself the favor. If you're heading on the light rail and feel hunger strike, stop off here and enjoy a nice meal. They have good lunch specials around $7.50 for a full plate with meat, hummus, garlic sauce, pita, and tabouli. Mmmm!"
_qTzOkbin2giDOrFsaxm8A,"The City of Angles, Los Angles, has to be one of my favorite foodie destinations. Pretty much every food trend over the past 5 years or so has its epicenter in LA. From Korean style frozen yogurt to cupcakes and now food trucks, the people of LA know a good thing when they taste it. While all of these trends have some how made their way to the Valley of the Sun, there's one thing that I've never been able to find here, garlic sauce like the one that's served at the LA institution Zankou Chicken.  If you've heard of Zankou and its amazing Lebanese chicken and tangy fluffy garlic sauce you know exactly what I mean when I say it's ethereal. For those who've never tried it either pack an overnight bag and head to LA or drive down to 20th Street and Van Buren to Al-Hana inside of Baiz market, its the closest thing to Zankou Chicken in Phoenix and its close location makes it even better.The area located around Baiz Market might seem a little rough around the edges but the market itself is clean, well lit and packed with all sorts of interesting Middle Eastern grocery items from dairy and fresh produce to meat and hookah paraphernalia. Tucked in the corner of the market is Al-Hana, a postage stamp sized restaurant specializing in, you guessed it Middle Eastern cooking. While the offerings might seem typical the flavors are bold and shouldn't be missed. The creamy roasted eggplant dip Babaghannuj ($4.49) had a smokiness usually not found in many other places. Al-Hana leaves their version thick and chunky with just the right amount of olive oil drizzled over the top. Ordering the Falafel Plate ($5.99) will get you 6 deep fried cumin scented pucks of ground chickpeas and fava beans. Pile a couple of these onto a freshly baked pita, slather with tahini and enjoy the crunch. Id also highly recommend the Labneh Pie ($2.99) which is filled with labneh, a Lebanese cream cheese, onions and tomatoes all baked in a light tender crust. The main dish for me was of course the Whole Roasted Chicken ($9.99). It comes with pita, pickles and garlic sauce. The chicken itself is so well seasoned and juicy it would seem like a crime to adorn it with anything until you get some garlic sauce on it. The texture is light and fluffy, almost like a garlicky mayonnaise. After one taste you might ask them for another container, seriously delicious. After a wonderful meal you'd think there wouldn't be enough room left for desert, but my rule is there's always room. With that I sauntered to the back of Baiz Market where their in store bakery is located, most of the case filled delights are around $2 each including a flaky syrup soaked baklava. While I love LA, knowing that I don't have to drive 300 miles to get my garlic sauce fix makes the drive across town all the tastier. Al-Hana inside Baiz MarketOpen Daily"
z1Np8_oQECKWGCwJJ8864w,"My rating is based on this first review... not on the second.On my first visit to Z Tejas, I went at lunchtime with 2 guys from Boeing.  We had to sit at the bar since the restaurant was so crowded.  As I scanned the menu, the Grilled Green Chile Pork Enchiladas with green chile sauce and a tomato-avocado chopped salad caught my eye... and I'm glad it did.I dont necessarily consider myself an 'enchilada' type of guy, but this dish provided me with the best I've ever tasted.  I recommend this dish, with no reservations.Now for my second review.My boss and I headed to Z Tejas today.  I figured that I'd mix it up and try something new.  Bad choice.I was feeling a bit famished, so I ordered the more expensive menu item, which was Jack's Five-Cheese Macaroni Achiote.  The grilled chicken with bleu, Jack, cheddar, parmesan and romano cheeses and bacon gratin sounded like a complete winner.Where to begin?The dish incorporates real cheese, which I would normally find appetizing.  However, in this case, the entree was served piping hot, causing the cheese to string everywhere.  Kind of messy for a lunchtime meal.  So, I ate slow, in hopes that the threadlike curd would solidify some.  Well, it did, but it also left, what can only be depicted as an oily scramble, in the bottom of the bowl, due to separation.  Delectable!Well, I decided to ease up on the 'roni, and move on to the chicken, which was served with skin on.  Visually, the skin looked crispy... but I realized my peepers were punked when I chewed up on some rubbery epidermis.Swoop Says: skip the mac 'n cheeze, go for the whole enchilada!In other news, the server at the bar was top notch.  She refilled my palmer again and again, until my bladder shouted: 'Uncle!'.  When you need some pampering, saddle up to the bar.~Swoop"
1CNKe3H07sLu6rigOpAYsg,"D&B has Wednesday Havana Nights on their roof top patio!  With temps dropping down, it was great to start the free lesson at 7p followed with dancing at 8p.  Most of the crowd is probably the ASU salsa class and friends, as its their instructor leading the lesson.That said, it is a very friendly and comfortable atmosphere... I didn't see any of the die hard salseros, so perhaps they left this venue for the newer, fresher crowd.Great place to take beginners to medium level.  DJ also played bachata!!!"
luCSjoNQ9q_0QIjKKOy2pQ,"I just don't think I'm much of a brewery gal. Granted, the beer here blows Four Peaks out of the water, but I'd much rather have a nice cocktail than chew though a specialty brew. But if beer is your poison of choice, they've got just about everything. The happy hour is kind of weak here though, with like a buck off all drafts. Thoroughly meh.You can peruse the coolers and grab a cold one or choose from 20+ drafts they have on the menu. No Bud Light here though. Sorry frat chumps. They used to have a ton of wine here as well (like, ages ago) but it has since been narrowed down to just four choices, none of which were calling my name this last go round. Their Orange Blossom wheat beer was a bit like drinking an orange creamsicle in beer form. Almost like a cider with floral notes, a light finish and a super creamy mouthfeel. (Oh yeah, bitches. I just went there.) The perfect beer for the novice drinker to enjoy. Their IPA was also pretty decent, but was more bitter than I care for, although it stayed far away from feeling like I was drinking a bottle of grassy perfume. Solid.I thought they had deals on happy hour food (again, like a buck off) but last time I went it was no dice. At least the food's reasonably priced. Tasty rueben, craptastic hummus, crispy quesadilla. The acoustics in this place are kind of shitty, so go on an off time when it won't be packed, or run the risk of smiling and nodding amicably while hearing every other snippet of convo. The high top tables are also really uncomfortable for shorties like me to sit at, but c'est la vie. My biggest peeve about this place is the gigando assy television against the wall. For a place this small, a big ass mofo tv is just  not the way to go."
lAGDe38li38fyf971CslFg,"This place is delicious!!I have been here a couple of times. Tonight was the first time I ordered take out.  My food was ready in 10 minutes!  They packaged it up with care and added a round cookie and a sugar cookie. I ordered the orange chicken and the crab Rangoon. Both where super delicious. I have plenty left over!!  The orange chicken had nice size pieces of juicy chicken breast lightly breaded and not overly spicy. I do love the decor in here!!  It's quirky but that's what makes it cool!  The only bummer about take out is you don't get the wonderful banana wontons everyone raved about but I'm sure they'd throw it in if you asked!! Love this place!!"
IPsG_71MD8pwB9i3TKOJYg,"Purely authentic food. Very tasty, wonderful atmosphere. I have yet to dive into their full offerings, but this will be a regular rotation for me."
Pr9rQKypHgC_J1AfufxzIw,"It's about 8:30AM Monday morning and I'm getting a little anxious.  Refresh my inbox, grr still not there.  Somedays I lose my patience, I can't wait a moment longer and go to the website directly.  Ahhh the weekly Wildflower Soup Rotation.  I am a soup person and I am extremely fond of their soups here, but I have to say I am mildly obsessed with their currently on their Wednesday & Saturday rotation Forest Mushroom soup.  Okay if you are a fan of mushrooms you are missing out on the pot of gold at the end of your fungi rainbow :)  This soup has it all, wood ear, crimini, king, probably even some of those good old fashioned white buttons too, in a rich, slightly thick, broth with a hint of wine that truly brings it to another level.  I mean the first time I had this soup I looked around to make sure I was really sitting in a casual concept lunch-driven eatery and not a white tablecloth, escargot eating establishment.I also have not had a sandwhich or saladhere I have not liked, the quality of the food frankly still surprises me as this local chain continues to expand.  The only downside is I don't think their pastry side is as fantastic as the savory portion of their menu, but hey I will happily skip the peach muffin for another cup of soup.  Also the Pima location is my favorite, the staff is extremely courteous, friendly and cheerful!PS They are great with mixing soups here too and won't give you the funny face or we don't know how to do that answer you may get from other restaurants.  Try Italian pepper and the tomato soup or Chicken Curry with the Roasted Corn!"
Gq092IH6eZqhAXwtXcwc6A,"I live here and Pierre T. pointed out...how many choices do I have..? Turns out snooty urban hipster is right, damn him. So, why is San Tan so average? Beats me. It shouldn't be and some times it is not. There are times when the burgers are the best, the food comes out on time and the beer is fantastic. They are making a new porter right now and it is amazing. Amazing as in, wow, you got this spot on and yes, I will take some home...Ha, I live next to a place where I can get take out beer. Unfortunately, not all the take out beer is that good. The porter is the chocolate milk of porters. Now on the same day as my discovery of the super porter, my club sandwich was absolutely unremarkable. So, for the luv of all that is average in Chandler, come on San Tan try harder god damnit, I've got no where else to go!"
AaKlegu7gmOCD4rEESF76Q,"Maizie's, I will miss you. I had my last meal today there since I will be moving from the Valley next week. Of course I had to get my two favorite items on the menu one last time: basil pesto bruschetta and the groovy grilled cheese. The bread for the bruschetta is always perfectly toasted and the groovy grilled cheese found the perfect blend of brie, apple and bacon.I only got to go to Maizie's once for brunch, but it was delicious. I really enjoyed my omelet with feta, cheddar and black olives. It's actually making my mouth water now thinking about it. I guess I better learn to cook so I can make it for myself. Mimosas are $3 and I have heard that they even have pitchers of mimosa during brunch!This is a great neighborhood spot and I am going to miss it!"
NCbHGtOP5yJBJsPPaE3X5g,This has got to be my favorite Indian Restaurant in the valley. Super clean and welcoming plus the staff is very nice. I went for the lunch buffet and it was absolutely delicious. The options include vegetarian and meat dishes that are well prepared.
18TUn9oiW0k0yB6lheiOvw,"Sometimes a girl gets a wicked hankerin' for some chicken fried steak, mashed taters, and white gravy.  You know that what she does?  She goes to Texaz Grill.For a ridiculously satisfying and heart clogging meal, you can't beat it.  It's got a casual and fun atmosphere, and it's extremely reasonably priced.  And best of all, the bar has a total honky tonk feel that makes me want to run home and play Urban Cowboy with the mister."
W7xb2iS4cYL14Yi5LOGSkA,"I liked this place in previous years when their selection was more focused on the quality craft beers.  For the longest time I could get a great milk stout here.  On my last visit one of the neon beer logos in the window was not actually available on tap any longer, and many of the better craft beers had disappeared.  It's becoming more of a college dive bar with mediocre food and sligthly high prices.  Music was loud too, but perhaps I'm just getting too old for this place."
E7nk0lC317pGxMX56gvaVQ,"This is a fun little place in Scottsdale! A friend and I were looking to grab lunch while escaping the heat, and Bungalow proved to be the perfect solution. Service was a little crappy, but it was nice how the whole front of the place was open... you could get fresh air, but didn't feel like you were slowly dying from the heat of the desert air. Which is always a great thing.Our server definitely had a bad-itude going on, and clearly wasn't that excited to be serving us, but the show went on. She got our drinks and eye-rolled when we asked for water (really? It's 100 degrees!) so we kinda just chose to ignore her and have a nice lunch anyway. We weren't crazy hungry so we split the Bungalow Bites (four sirloin sliders with white American cheese and aujus for dipping) and we each got a side of grilled vegetables. The bites were super, super good! The meat was cooked just perfectly and the cheese was a nice touch. I could have eaten all four without splitting them, they were that great. The vegetables were cooked very well too, and seasoned just right. I was a happy camper.The prices were pretty affordable and the menu was a good size, so I'd call that a good situation. If only the server would have been as content as we were!"
TnkxapUN4nWMz_z5h3qMYg,"I'm a fan of the whole Pita Jungle family, so I was pretty pleased with the newest addition. Working at the Downtown campus of ASU, there are certainly some great spots (especially when the food trucks hit on Friday), but having some pita goodness less than 5 minutes away is nice. I actually missed the grand opening by....well, about 5 months, but better late than never!So first, this place is basically a ""spic-and-span'd "" version of the Tempe and Indian School PJ's. For Desert Ridge and Downtown, the Jungle seems to have cleaned up their act a bit, with the ambiance and serving staff. Not that I dislike the punk chics with sleeve tattoos at the other locations (cute inked girls are never a bad thing), but you can see that the Roosevelt location is trying to draw in the business crowd. It must be pretty successful; we got there at 11:15 with the place half empty, and it was packed within 15 minutes.Our server was very good, on top of our table (in a good way) during the entire lunch. I am pretty easy at Pita Jungle; I am legally addicted to their hummus, so I just got the Hummus with Sirloin while my lunch-mate ordered a greek salad and dolma. Everything was fantastic. I have never had a bad order of hummus from PJ (and there have been A LOT of orders), and the sirloin was really good. I was used to the chicken, but the steak was a welcome change. I even grabbed a dolma from CM, which was very good, almost like a full sushi roll with just rice.Overall, it was a very good lunch experience. I would suggest getting there early to avoid the lunch rush and dive into some pureed chickpea splendor."
zSzE4rW9FE3fGqiEzZ91Vw,"I walk past this place every day on my way to class and finally managed to stop in and try it out. The inside of the place is tiny. Fortunately they have a lot of outside seating for everyone. I wasn't quite sure what I wanted, so I grabbed one of the menus to take a look. To be honest, I expected there to be more on the menu. Based on the menu, you can get a Taco, Burrito, Torta, Quesadilla, or Vampiro. That sounds like a decent number of choices, because in most places you get the choice of Chicken, Pork a few different ways, beef (shredded, ground, or carne asada), fish, etc. Here, the only choices listed were Carne Asada and Pastor (a marinated pork). I thought the Pastor sounded good, but was disappointed that those are the only choices.The other thing that struck me is that the descriptions on the menu are not that accurate. The quesadilla and the vampiro have the SAME description, except that one lists flour tortilla and one lists corn tortilla. So, I ordered the vampiro because of the corn tortilla and because the price was a dollar less. When I got it, i found out that it is not at all like a quesadilla, and is in fact a lot like a tostada, not something that I had hoped for. It was open face and the tortilla was fried crisp. Also, IT WAS TINY. The vampiro was almost $4.00, it was much smaller than a standard tostada, and it wasn't loaded with the meat and toppings. The food didn't taste bad, but I wasn't thrilled with it, either.All-in-all, I'm not sure ill be back. For that price and size, the food should be better. If the size goes up, price goes down, or the taste improves, then I'll probably come back. Until then, though, my go-to mexican place is Carolina's."
WxpCYziMlEy8mrEa_VcB1w,"Jury duty makes you hungry.  I rushed over here one fateful fall day from the courthouse a few miles away and had a pleasant enough meal.  The staff was lovely and the patio was a nice place to get some reading done.  All in all, though, the food was pretty unremarkable.  It's Mexico City-style food, so it's not quite your typical Tex-Mex fare.  Not a problem, but there are so many other places to spend your dough.  Meh."
YnWb8fRudnNkXc-VjrmKGg,"Surprise!  A Vietnamese restaurant in Surprise.  I ordered bun noodles with beef/lemongrass to go.  I waited at the bar, and the service was great.  The owner sat next to me and had a plate of spring rolls.  I made a comment on how tasty they looked, and he asked if I wanted one.  I think that's when I knew I loved this place.  Anyhow, I got home and tasted my food.  Awesome.  The noodles were cooked perfectly (not soggy), and there were plenty of veggies and meat.  The nuoc mam had a lot of flavor as well. (You can have really good food, but if you have crappy nuoc mam, your food won't taste right.)  I think I'm gonna have to start ordering to-go weekly."
BK51tV_XtCm3UHwRVyCuqQ,"We were looking for a place to grab brunch last Sunday morning in Old Town, and stumbled on this place. ""Bacon""?I said ""Oh that's not a restaurant, it's some sort of upscale massage parlor with a funky name"", but she made me stop.I LOVE the way that this place feels inside-Jospeh Eichler would approve. And so do I!! It's a low-slung midcentury modern interior mixed with some tasteful homespun artifacts to remind you that you are there for comfort food.The coffee is great- the food is well, ""OK"", but honestly, the place feels so nice and relaxing and the staff is so cool that I think it makes you want to party- IN THE MORNING!I saw as many people drinking Mimosas and Bloody Mary's as I did eating!This will be a great place to bring out-of-town guests, but If the kitchen ever catches up with the ambience you won't be able to get a seat there on the weekend."
jnzROxEjNkgeo5Ju3F8qzQ,"Good chips and salsa, like that they give you 3 different salsas. Both their beans are vegetarian, awesome. I recommend the black bean and cheese burrito enchilada style. Some people like the outdoor seating but the smell of the duck pond is pretty sick."
6YWp7frmHKuPLYSlPyUdsw,"Don't quite think it's bringing sexy back....What can't I say about this place that hasn't been said before?Food:  they have a new chef, so apparently they heard others talking badly about the food.  I actually really enjoyed the food and our server was awesome.  Ridiculously expensive?  Yes.  Good to my tum?  Definitely.  We decided to try a little of everything so in our menu was the Seared Ahi, Chopped salad with bacon dates, Tenderloin empanadas, Mozzarella and heirloom tomatoes, and sweet potato fries.Ahi was seared perfectly.  It had a slightly spicey musky sauce with it.  Very yum unless you don't like raw-ish fish.  Bacon dates are my new favorite.  Mmmm.  Empanadas were good, but you didn't really get much of a meat flavor.  Caprese was wonderfully fresh.  Sweet potato fries....god yes.Price per dish around $9 to $14.  You're looking at about $25 for an entree.  Drinks were relatively decent in price...but $12 for a glass of wine.  My favorite Reisling is $12 per bottle, for crying out loud.This place is AWESOME for people watching.  Young things with massive...melons of flesh, meat-head men trying to look cool, 50+ women trying to outdo the young things, and 50+ men ogling everyone creepily.The singers on stage were quite cheesy.  Great choice in music, but I'd much rather listen to the DJ version than a upscale karaoke.  No dude, you're NOT bringing sexy back with those aviator shades and check shirt.  And whoa...the female singer...honey, you need someone else to do your extentions.Wierd mix of dress code:  from prom date to stained t-shirts.  Ugh.$9 for a pack of cigs (I don't smoke, but I heard) and you can order a drink in the bathroom.  Wha?  So you can drink and pee all night long and never have to leave the room?Funny, funny place.  I'd probably go again mainly for the abundance of people watching.  This place doesn't get more than three mainly for the cheese factor and the prices.  At least sugar daddies abound at this place."
w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,"I would describe Raising Cane's as the chicken version of In-N-Out because they only sell one thing and that's chicken strips.The restaurant is decorated with Movie memorabilia. It's kind of odd considering it has nothing to do with the food but I liked it. The employees genuinely seem happy to be there and are extremely helpful.My boyfriend and I both ordered the chicken finger sandwich with fries and a drink. The fries were great and I enjoyed my chicken sandwich. I don't know how to describe the taste of their house sauce but I like it a lot. I used it on my fries and my sandwich. I had a good experience here. I think they need to jazz up the menu with more sauces and offer additional side items. I'll be back when I have a random craving for tasty chicken fingers!"
KIgkwPEOxbfdeCk0ltycOQ,"Did you ever wonder why most Mexican food places taste the same? I mean, there's a range of flavors across American cuisine... why isn't it the same with Mexican food.Turns out, there is some variety. It just tends to get glossed over and dumbed down. But not at Maria Maria.I have no idea if this is authentic Mexican food or not. I only know that's damned tasty. Yes, you're going to encounter strange spices and flavors that you aren't used to. Yes, it's going to make you wonder exactly what it is you are eating. And yes, you're going to enjoy the experience.My personal recommendations: chili rellenos. I'm a sort of connoisseur of this dish. I've found three places on the planet that make them the best: this is one. They take liberal poetic license with the dish. And gods, I love them for it.The carnitas are also fantastic. Very rich and flavorful.  My wife always -- and I mean always -- gets the seafood guacamole and a side of plantains. She's happy for days after.Go. Now."
RQWliUrWic_b5FZEj3JThQ,"Our first visit here was an accident, I guess there is no Riga Tony's in the bay area (where I'm from), but was pleasantly surprised. The only reason it doesn't get all 5 stars is because of the incredible wait that we had the past 5ish times that we've went. It's usually always busy and we end up waiting no matter if it is a weekday or weekend. My favorite is the choice of 1 or 2 lb. of clams on the appetizers, deeelicious! Too bad the shells count for most of the weight, but the lemony, oil sauce that it's swimming in really adds flavor. We've always had pretty slow service, not that they're not friendly, just kinda slow...I remember got sat (after a 30 min. wait), and waited another 20 min. before the waiter greeted us. The food made it up though. They have a wide variety of different pastas and seafood, but the clam linguini is sssoooo scrumptuous.  Love love love the bottomless salad. Much better than Olive Garden. lolOne time the waiter spilled all 3 large waters on our table and got us wet, but they cleaned it up right away and the manger came over, apologized, and said the appetizers were on them. Can you say.. awesome? It always seems like a different story whenever we come here, not sure if that's a good or bad thing..."
YQvg0JCGRFUkb6reMMf3Iw,"I'm addicted, my favorite restaurant in Tempe!  Craving the chopped salad and a white sangria sometimes keeps me up at night.  I also find myself paying for others to ensure they'll go with me again :)  The ambiance is fantastic, and wait staff is attentive and friendly. Also try the bruschetta | options: get the pork if you like sweet and spicy, get the traditional mozzerella, basil & tomoto, the chicken - - heck, try them all!Oh wait! I almost forgot, the Tiramisu -  is def something to write home about!"
kFVapB4z_5VoOnYazF_ERA,"Not much to say here, but if you haven't tried Oregano's yet... stop what you're doing and go now!  They have a huge menu with tons of tasty stuff to choose from.  We almost always split a large whole wheat thin crust pizza and have a couple tall sunshine wheat beers; it's a little greasy and full of calories, but its comfort food at its best.   I have also tried their pastas, veggie sandwich and fried ravioli's too, and was equally as pleased.  The menu is very inexpensive for the portion sizes, and the service is always good.  I would recommend either getting there early or plan on waiting for a while, because it is always packed."
XkNQVTkCEzBrq7OlRHI11Q,"I love Pizza-A-Metro and so does Joe Arpaio. I am quite certain it is the only thing we have in common.This is where I take my foodie friends because they are usually so busy eating they shut up for a while. (I kid, I kid...) I have never had anything here that I don't find super delicious and crave-worthy. The first time I went here my party was personally doted on by Maurizio, who was over-the-top gracious and seemed to truly love what he was doing.  While I don't see him every time I am here, the service never suffers.The calamari is crisp and light, which is a nice change from heavy, fried calamari that is so ubiquitous in too many Italian joints. Hands down my favorite item on the menu is the Frescolina. The combination of the arugula and prosciutto makes my mouth water even thinking about it!So next time you are at Pizza-A-Metro, my advice is don't loudly discuss if the portly man next to you is Joe Arpaio. Don't look him up on your Blackberry and pass the photo around to get the opinion of your fellow diners. Don't bring up that his mother died in childbirth, and how that potentially explains a great deal of the man's 'politics.' No matter how much wine you have had, do not forget how small this restaurant is. Because in the end, after he and his bodyguards leave, the server will tell you- Yeah. That was him."
mWTFbL-ilQiQ9iQwPnViQw,"After reading all the 5 Star raves for this place it was something of a disappointment for me.  Arlin B., Mike C., & I dropped in for lunch today after coming last Thursday when they were supposed to be open at 11 AM but never opened as we waited a while.This time we waited until 12 to arrive, & they were open.  Our server said yes, they should have  opened last time at 11!I ordered the Jerk Chicken plate, which the menu says comes with mashed potatoes & broccoli, but mine came with a bed of flavored rice under the chicken. For sides, I had the Beef Dumpling Soup, & shared small orders of Pof Pof & Jamaican Patties with the others.I thought all the food was ok, but loud music played during most of our visit, & this lunch was EXPENSIVE...  over $50 for the three of us, with just water to drink!I think Ocean Blue in Chandler is a better choice for this kind of food, & I'm pretty sure this was a one visit restaurant for me.     :-|"
lvpXyfTDF5WZnjzc36r5Wg,"I've been here quite a few times, and always love their food. Pretty good servings for the amount of money. Burger yesterday was a bit over-cooked, but the fries were great as always. I love how small it is - friendly staff and it always seems like the whole family is back there cooking and serving. Would definitely recommend. So all in all, great for the money, and convenient because it's close to my work, but I wouldn't drive across town for it."
