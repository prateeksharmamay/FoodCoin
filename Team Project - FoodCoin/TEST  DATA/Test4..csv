ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323f70),"We had a great mid-week lunch experience at the C4. The weather had warmed enough to sit out on the North patio in the shade.  We each had a starter, sandwich and desert and received attentive food service from Armon and beverage service from Stacey.  As explained to us the chefs specialize in their native style so for starters we had the ""Tres Queso"" Quesadilla with chicken and the Baja Crab Cakes.  Each was a cut above the norm from our experience plus smaller to fit our appetites.  The crab cake sauce and guacamole were outstanding accompaniments.  We then chose sandwiches as our next  course.  The chicken ""Cordon Blue"" with capicola ham and sharp cheddar was not fried as one might anticipate but rather a toasted whole grain bread.  Very tasty and worth experiencing again.  The California club was nothing to write home about but an enhancement would have been fresh sliced warm turkey vs. cold turkey (hint to owner).  We don't normally order desert but couldn't resist trying the frozen lime tart and the house churned ice cream of the day (pina colada).  Both would be very good with a drink overlooking a sunset but it was only 1 PM and we were in the shade...  We took a self-guided tour of the enchanting hotel pool and discovered the roof patio which looks inviting in the evening.  As a an early riser (see my sunrises) I can tell we will have to return for an unobstructed sunset in the future with light cloud cover.   As locals we probably wouldn't stay at the Boutique Hotel but noted the covered parking plus relative proximity to downtown for short walks to Steele Indian School Park and the high rises along Central."

This place hit the spot.Cauliflower soup... omg. Delicious. I talk about it still. I had the strawberry salad and soup combo. It was an easy 8 bucks. My sister and Mom had some other stuff, I was way too proccupied with my delicious soup to give notice. And it came with a dipped strawberry. heaven.Is this place a chain? It is such a good chain if it is. Everything was great. My only complaint is that they're closed on Sundays. I hate establishments that are closed on Sundays, I think it's dumb. I drove my whole family here one Sunday afternoon, all excited to introduce my husband to the delicious selection and they were closed. ugh. We're going tomorrow. Maybe that will ease my bitterness of the Sunday thing and cause an extra star to be added.. we will see."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b5632559a),"My new favorite dish at PCG (actually anywhere) is the new Surf N Turf Pasta entree. It is freakin' amazing! Cooked to order medallions of beef (I believe its filet) and HUGE prawns over a bed of fettuccine noodles. Seasoned with diced green chilies, corn, and a bit of cheese, it's""s a bit spicy, but over all just so dang tasty. I also have recently tried their Dreamy Draw Chili and it is a winner. Made of pinto beans, it's""s different from your traditional red sauce chili. I honestly have not had a bad dish at PCG. Kim is the best server they have, but maybe we're biased because we know her. If you still have not tried PCG, make it a point to do so soon. I hear their parking lot remodel is completed. :)"
ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b563245d6),"Finally... FINALLY I managed to visit D'licious Dishes!  After years of traveling past it and telling myself, ""I need to go in there,"" I managed to get my lazy butt there and give it a try.  And, oh boy, it lived up to what everyone has been saying.  The customer service was spectacular and the food just as amazing.The first thing I saw when I entered was their dessert case. I was dying just looking at the scrumptious offerings.  I desperately wanted to get some goodies, but I was being good and was going to go the ""as-healthy-as-I-can"" route.  I was greeted by the owner, I think, who asked me if this was my first time visiting.  When I said yes, she proceeded to explain what they offered, the pricing and the specials they had for the day.  I placed my order for the Turkey Pita, and while waiting for them to prepare it, I looked around the tiny store.  I starred longingly at the dishes in the display case, thinking about what I would want for my next visit. After a few minutes, the order was ready, I paid and I was on my way.  It initially seemed a little pricey for a sandwich, but the more I thought about it, I realized I pay almost the same thing for a sandwich at Paradise Bakery, but this sandwich was beyond comparison to those. It was made-to-order and made from love (I like to think, anyway)!  That's priceless, isn't it?!I'm so glad I finally decided to check out D'licious Dishes.  I definitely won't be waiting for long before I come back to try more of their selections. And, the next time, I won't be so good -- I'm getting a dessert with my meal no matter what!"
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323666),"After reading some of the rips on the Compass Arizona Grill, I thought we should investigate the badness on our anniversary. We've been several times over the years and it's usually fine. If you've read anything I've written, you know I'm uncouth, ill-educated, lacking taste and manners. Consider also I usually write about remote rural spots serving iceberg lettuce salads, white bread, instant mashed potatoes,brown gravy from cans and chicken fried steak. I called our reservation in four days early, was asked if we'd dined before. We were in the database. I was asked if it was a special event. We couldn't get a 7:30 to 8:30 slot, so took 6:30. I was asked if I wanted anything special. I didn't think to ask for a bottle of Fre champagne or bottle of Navarro Gew?årztraminer or Pinot Noir juice. We were greeted promptly, wished happy anniversary, and seated immediately. Nina served the water and appetizers, Jerry served drinks and food. Each course had its own plating and service.  Jerry's served here since the first 360 degree spin in 1976, so has some experience. The menu's southwest.  Subtle chile, cilantro and blue corn in menu items. The appetizer bread was cornbread with corn kernels and green chile added. Regular and honey butter were delivered along with sea salt crystals for dinner seasoning. That's good corn bread.  I had 2.5 tiny servings.  Our wines were Fre ros?? and red, both on the Compass Grill list. Of our courses, the black bean soup with diced chile and cilantro sprouts and the rib eye steak were excellent. The crispy brie appetizer and salad were good. Being ill-mannered, House Salad springy field greens and tiny red tomatoes lubricated with house dressing elude my fork and knife. Fortunately, I shot no tomatoes across the room as frequently happens to me. The citrus vinaigrette under the brie was also excellent. I recommend a thorough swishing of cheese, arugula and candied pecan to get the most vinaigrette from the plate. One can get the last sweet-citrus streaks with the tiny tomato halves. I ordered the veggie entree, Seared balsamic glazed oyster mushroom and eggplant on a bed of quinoa and couscous with apricot. Cut the mushroom and eggplant, mix it with the harvest grains, and a good veggie meal's been served. Not as good eaten separately. Coffee and strawberry shortcake for dessert. Coffee much better than some highly touted Phoenix dineries. Strawberry shortcake an appropriately modern, 24th story serving. Along our 90 minute journey, we got 540 degrees of the Phoenix horizon, from daylight to night. The 21st century view is pretty cluttered up with bank towers and the calloused handed, big bicepped Freeport-McMoran corporate HQ. Rather than tall view-blocking bank towers, I'd have been lots happier with shorter ostentation, lower fees and higher interest on my hard-kept savings. Lots less than 75,000 bank-owned homes in Phoenix and more employees would also have been nice. Like I said, I'm uncouth, ill-educated, lacking taste and manners.We may all be in for mixed experiences here."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56325725),"I really like Touch of Thai. My eating out adventures usually stem from my good friend Kevin, who is a vegetarian, and though very nice, I wouldn't want to serve him in a restaurant, just very picky.... Kevin loves this place, always suggesting that we go there, the other day I happily agreed, as it is not even very far from my house. The service is always great, very nice people run this place. Become a regular (like my friend Kevin) and the service and food is even better. This time we had the Tohm Khah soup with tofu, it had always been one of my favorites as i think it blends spice and coconut milk together so very nicely. make sure to order some steamed rice to come along with the soup as it is perfect to soak up all the goodness. We also had the Panang Curry with tofu, and it has carrots and green beans in it too, med spice on this one today was pretty warm, but not to the point where we couldn't enjoy our meal. As for the price, a great deal. Lunch combos for only 5.95, and our soup was 8.95 and was enough for both of us to enjoy we didn't even finish it all and took it home for later. For some reason even tho the decor is kinda...well.....i don't know the right word for it.... but anyway for some reason this place just makes me only want to eat out at local business you know, make sure my income goes back into the local community? I only have one suggestion, maybe some patio seating?, maybe just even two tables outside, the biker bar two or three businesses down the strip mall, doesn't bother or ""scare"" me at all. Its just nice to be outside sometimes.oh one last tip if you've never been here...  Mon thru Fri they close for a break @ 2:30pm and then reopen for dinner @ 5pm . But sat and sunday they are open from noon till ten I think."
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b563237e8),"I'm really lucky to live where I live.  I have a good number of places to eat that are all within walking distance or along the lightrail.  This little gem of a place on Roosevelt has been a favorite of mine and the husband's.  It's a tiny little place with minimal parking in the back, but it packs a punch for it's size.Inside you will find a small but comprehensive selection of some Italian staples that may be more difficult to find in other areas.  They have pizzelle, anise, spices, and even some specialty imported tomato sauces.  Their meat and cheese selection is also small but comprehensive. Everything always looks fresh and tasty.  They keep everything in smaller quantities so I take comfort in the fact that they aren't selling me old crappy food.  When we eat here, I typically get the gnocchi.  Now, it certainly isn't the best.  I'm pretty sure it has been previously frozen, or maybe the same stuff that they stock on their shelves.  However, it's still a tasty gnocchi.  Tender potato dumplings sit in a pool of yummy marinara sauce.  I'm not typically a fan of marinara sauce, but in this case, I love it.  It's a really simple sauce with just the right amount of basil and oregano to remind me of what Italian food should taste like.I once got the chicken salad sandwich here.  I love chicken salad and will usually try it when presented with the opportunity.  Unfortunately, I really did not like this kind.  It was a little on the dry side for my taste, but man was this SPICY!  It was overwhelming to me, maybe in part to the fact that I was not expecting it.  However, the husband finished it off and really really enjoyed it.Finally, anything with meatballs on it from here is a solid choice.  They are big and flavorful with a delicate blend of spices mixed in.  I'm not sure if they use meat other than beef in there, but I have a feeling they might use lamb.  Yum.Overall, a good bet if you are downtown and want a good Italian Sub."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56325118),"Well the first time I came to this location it's was the trusty ol' Great Escape and that was definitely a DIVE a legit ""hole in the wall"" ha! However it's is now an upscale/urban bar hangout. It's super cozy and it brings in  21-35 age group. I loved the music and decor. You are literally surrounded by logs. And the bar is perfect super old school and the bar staff are awesome. The only criticism I have is that the seatting is awkward and I wish there was a patio but I know because of the location there are legal issues.All in all, I will definitely go back I live walking distance from it so its the perfect  for me,the boyfriend and friends to add this place to our bar bike tour ;)"
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b563236d4),"Well we wont be back again. This place could be so cool but I don't really care for the menu and we have been unhappy with the food the last two times we have been and this last waitress sealed the deal for me. The waitress we had this time seem to be in la la  land. She forgot about comin back to take our dinner order after we ordered wings, she couldn't seem to finish her sentences, and really didn't seem to give a shit about us and she only had one other table. The chicken sandwich is not the same as the one I had the first time. This was a chicken breast with the fat still on it, totally untrimmed. Chicken fat in your mouth is the most disgusting thing ever. Also the bread was hard and it was not cause it was toasted to much it had dried out from sitting out un covered. Hard as a rock! They tried to tell me it was toasted but, lol, there was  no color at all, meaning not toasted, not dark, I hate being bull shitted, people make mistakes so just admit it don't bull shit me ass hole. I sent it back and did not get anything else. If these cooks here cant prep a chicken breast then who knows what else there doin back there, this is basics. My girlfriend got the grilled cheese and mac n cheese. Again bread not toasted, totally white and cheese not really melted. Um do these people know what a grilled cheese even is. Unreal. The bread was to thick for the amount of cheese. Imagine two pieces of texas thick sliced bread and one slice of cheese, lol this place is a joke. The mac and cheese is watery and no flavor. See ya Garage. If you cant make a grilled cheese, mac n cheese ,or a chicken sandwich that's even acceptable then forget it. I guess if you have a burger and wings here you may be happy that's it."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56325035),"What an amazing lunch deal!  As a vegetarian, I absolutely love this place!  All of the lunch specials are available with meat or tofu, so I don't have to worry about limitations.  The menu is vast, and there are curries and noodle dishes to choose from, in addition to other Thai favorites.  At lunch time, your noodle dish will come with either a salad or soup and a vegetarian egg roll.  All of that for under $5!  It's unbelievably delicious!  My personal favorite is Pad See Ew, and it's served well here, with a healthy amount of flavor and plenty of fresh vegetables.  It's my favorite place for lunch, hands down!"
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324b39),"Wonderful.  Love this place.  They cook breakfast exactly how I like it.Fast, fresh, perfect Western Omelet and smoky crisp bacon.They also have nice little touches.  Note how clean it is in there too.Fresh lemon for your water, like way fresh.  Excellent condiments, Lime Cholla sauce, nice.Oh and the French Toast?  Awesome.  Love how you order and they bring it to you, cafe style.  So much easier.I know, I know the line out the door kind of blows, but it moves pretty quick.  Great concept, I wish one would open up on the Westside, but don't mind a 15 minute drive to a great, quick, and reasonably priced breakfast.  Also, their coffee is very strong and very hot and they use really espresso in their coffee drinks.Highly recommended.  You can do much worse in a breakfast choice, that's for sure.I bet the lunch stuff is good too.Sunnyslope has come a long way, from wandering  street people shuffling around with IV poles fresh out of the hospital some 10-15 years ago, to a thriving, bustling, hip nuevo Cen Pho in its own right, cool eateries like Scramble really embody the spirit of a renewed socio-economic vigor in that area.Update***Went back for Lunchy Pooh, great BLT.  Simple but loved it.  Where do they get their bacon?  They have a new creme dispenser machine for your coffee, really cool with 4 different styles of cream I believe.  Weekdays are so much better here in terms of business than the weekends.Note to owner, I'm ready to start a punch card now (hint, hint :))"
ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b56323fb1),"The food, atmosphere, and crowd was great.But we must have gotten very unlucky with the server that night.  His service was worse than a Denny's, especially when you pay at least $100 a person.   Everyone at the table was very uncomfortable."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324e29),"Think Tuck Shop, the Vig, or St. Francis, but with a markedly obvious Latin fusion direction.Fine drinks, very friendly staff, and I find the restaurant's setting and location to lend itself well to the slightly rustic (and slightly dirty) overall feel of the Bistro.  But, whatever Fuego may be missing in terms of polish, it more than makes up for it with a menu of very tasty and moderately creative offerings.I would order meats with confidence here, especially their pork, as they seem to really know what they are doing with their slow cooking."
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323b3b),"I had the prosciutto sandwich, and it was delicious. That's all I'm going to say about the food. Dude, the service...it sucked. I am low maintenance, and am equipped with low expecations to match, and it still sucked. All I need is a smile and maybe, I don't know, a polite greeting of some kind, and I am satisfied in the service department. Totally didn't happen here. The restaurant, per its website and posted hours, opens at 10:00 AM. I can't imagine anyone actually goes there that early, but, okay. It's when they open. Now, as anyone who has worked downtown for more than a week knows, if you want to go somewhere and get in and out and back to your desk in a manageable amount of time, you need to adjust your lunch time aim - shoot for 11:30, or shoot for 1:30. Anything in between will only bring you lines, misery, and a bitch of a time parking...especially on 7th Street. So, I mosied on over to La Piccola Cucina at exactly 11:20...an hour and twenty minutes after they opened, mind. I walked in, and was greeted by a scowling, irritated-looking girl at front counter in a hot pink sweatshirt and super tight black pants, (the owner's daughter, I was able to ascertain from newspaper clippings posted on the restaurant walls). She looked at me and said, in a very put-upon tone...are you ready for this...""Yeah? What do you need?""""Yeah? What do you need?"" You're working at a restaurant...it's 11:30 at this point...I've approached the counter to order...and you're copping an attitude like you can't possibly imagine what I would be doing there? Right. Keep on keepin' on, girl. DIVA FOR LIFE!I said, ""Um...I'd like to order something to go..."" No menus are to be seen...I later discovered that the sandwich menu is posted on the wall somewhere, but this wasn't pointed out to me. Good thing I read some Yelp reviews before I went, so I had some idea of what was available...oh, PS - the gelato cases and the food cases were empty. Totally empty. Avoiding eye contact with me, she fumbled with a bunch of papers by the register, still looking completely annoyed by my existence,.""Uh, we're not even really OPEN yet."" I look behind me at the clock on the wall, and the front door that is propped open all the way. I had no idea how to respond to that, so I didn't. Just awkwardly stood there till she took my order. I ordered the prosciutto sandwich, no wilted greens. Of course, it came with wilted greens, which would be forgivable if I hadn't been treated like a leper. While I was waiting, another couple came in and was helped by the owner's wife...food/gelato cases were still empty, and she wasn't super friendly, but she at least acknowledged them as human beings and pointed out where the menus were.The owner, so often immortalized in Yelp reviews as a loud, friendly, brusque gentleman, just kind of lumbered around the restaurant, frowning, without a smile or word for anyone.My sandwich was awesome, but there are too many other mom-n'-pops downtown to even bother giving business to a place where the staff cops an attitude. Really and truly. Sucks for them, because I'm the kind of person who goes back to a place over and over again, and tries everything. I tell my friends and family, I write nice reviews on Yelp. In this case, several co-workers wanted to know where I got my sandwich from, and I lied. Sorry, guys. Attitude matters."
ObjectID(5165b71d74c3068b56325fec),"I have read a couple other reviews on this pub and I have to chuckle a little at some of the comments, one person even said it is not Irish enough.  Pardon me if I seem a little defensive but I have been going to this pub for years.  The person who created this pub could not be anymore Irish and even though Seamus is no longer the owner (he sold it to Frank his long time lead bartender several years ago) I can tell you it is still the same place.  I have to admit it is not uncommon for there to be a lot of patrons that are not necessarily there for the pub aspect as they are just looking for a drink before or after an event downtown.  That said the atmosphere has a lot of character being attached to a historic hotel, it has that vibe only an old building can have.  There are even some fun urban myths that go along with it.  Some people say the hotel is haunted and the pub is not immune from those rumors, just ask some of the women who have used the restroom upstairs.  For some reason I don't know of anything being said about the men's room that's right across the hall.  I have not heard anything too crazy I just think some women get themselves psyched out about the rumors before they even go up stairs.  Ultimately this is one of my favorite pubs and it's also one of the best places to be on St. Patrick's Day when they close the street off in front of the pub.  It is a surreal scene to see people partying at 8AM in the middle of the street in the heart of downtown Phoenix.  I hope to see you all there.  Slainte"
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b5632542b),"Yum!  I am so glad this place has opened and Robert McGrath is back doing what he is great at.  I won't hide the fact that I am a huge fan of his.  He catered the rehearsal dinner to my wedding with the great food of Roaring Fork (before it was sold).Went last night for an early dinner and the reservation list looked like it was extremely full.  We started with the signature green chile pork stew and it was delicious.  Slightly different than the way it was prepared at RF, but it is something I would definitely get again.  I had the Big Ass Burger (oops, I mean Bob's Burger) and it was fantastic.  It was slightly over cooked, but I attribute that to the kitchen still getting all of their timing down.  The burger and side of fries are huge and probably the best value on the menu for $12.My wife had the blackened catfish and said it was fantastic.  We also had some of the green chile mac, but we already knew that would be great.The best part about this new place is that the staff is very professional.  I can't tell you how many new restaurants I have been to where they end up hiring a bunch of kids who don't know anything about food or service.  Renegade seems to be staffed with people who are excited about the restaurant and it shows.Can't wait to go back.  Bar menu includes one of my old time favorites of Buzzard Breath Chili served in a bag of Fritos. We will definitely be back and this place will make it into our regular rotation of great places to go."
ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b56324765),"Should have listened to the numerous negative reviews on-line (and there were many) but we trusted Guy from Diners, Drivins & Dives ...BIG MISTAKE. Clue #1 Strip mall with huge cheesy banner boasting ""Food Network"" endorsement. Clue #2  Self serves sign-in waiting list, apparently, the slimy owner was too busy gushing over customers trying to eat but steering clear of unhappy ones.  Misters and drinking water would have been a nice touch to make the 10-20min 104 degree wait more bearable. The minute we saw the paper table cloths and plastic chairs,cups & utensils we were in trouble. One waiter frantically tried to service the whole restaurant, which was a complete zoo. Now according to Triple D, the pasta was homemade....aaaaaah.....not so much.... Ive been to Italy, I know the difference.  Cut to the chase, $27.00 for two a la carte / appetizer sized entrees.Seems to me, his only goal is cashing in on the TV appearance as quickly as possible with no concern to repeat business...Don't waste your time and money....On a positive note, Guy was right about Matts Big Breakfast in downtown Phoenix, great good and the best costumer service we've ever had."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324adc),"Every year I am in charge of bringing dessert from a local spot for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Last year we did an ice cream pie from Sweet Republic and that was good. But this year was different...This year we sorta flipped out when we tasted our creme brulees. We ordered a few pumpkin and then got a ton of different flavors so we could try them all. We sat in a circle and just passed them around going to town. They were all amazing. The winners though, were the classic vanilla and chocolate. As in, the kids were licking the containers. We didn't even think the kids would like them but they couldn't get enough. We loved it so much we are even doing it twice- Christmas here we come! I had the order delivered to my work, it came wrapped in a bow with an adorable re-usable container full of raw sugar for flaming. We used the broiler because our torch was out of gas and it turned out wonderful. I did a test on one of the brulees to get the hang of it. Prep time was about 15 minutes to do all 12 brulees. it was amazing. Julia is such a pleasure to work with as well. She is always quick to respond to e-mails and was right on time!"
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323f2e),"Eh, this place is okay.  I was not super impressed.  The food was okay.  I was not blown away.   After being seated, we sat at the table for a good 15 minutes without anyone noticing that no one had been to our table once.  We had to flag down a server.  Once we actually did have a server, the service was good.  I can forgive the glitch.  Everyone has a bad night.  But the food just lacked the wow factor.  Even though I have a twenty dollar gift certificate (to make up for the initial service issue) I have not been back.  I guess that about sums it up."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56325035),"I went here for lunch the other day. The lunch special was a decent $6.95 for a entr??e, salad or soup and a spring roll. I got the soup for starters; it was perfectly light and balanced with small cubes of tofu. For my entr??e I got the Chicken Masaman Curry it was okay, the potatoes were a little on the small side and I wish the curry was a little stronger. Spring roll was forgettable but the dipping sauce had a nice tang to it. I order the Thai custard for dessert and one word comes to mind... YUCK! It was served on top of some flavorless sticky rice the custard reminded me of an old flavorless flan. The Jasmine Hot tea was good but I still prefer Tasty Thai down the street."
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b563238a3),"We kind of ended up here by mistake.  We wanted to go to Four Peaks but didn't realize this wasn't it until we were inside, so we stayed anyway.  It was quite busy for a Saturday at 3pm, and a service was slow.  We ordered two appetizers when we placed our drink order and then placed our food order when our drinks came out.  About 20 minutes later out came our appetizers...with our food, and an apology from the manager.  Something about our appetizers order getting lost.  Anyway, they took the apps off our bill, so that was good.  Had the mozzarella sticks and the queso and chips.  Both were pretty yummy. I had the blackened fish tacos which were ok...nothing great.  The flour tortillas they use are WAY too big though.  I had to tear a good inch off the top, and the fish filet inside didn't even reach the ends of the tacos.  Everyone else had burgers, and they said they were good.All in all, not horrible, but I don't see us going back...not when there are so many other restaurants nearby.My 3 teenage boys thoroughly enjoyed the scantily dressed waitresses though.  My one son said ""this place shouldn't be called a brewery, it should be called a boobery!"". Too funny.  (this place is not a brewery, but we had told them were we're going to four peaks)."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324b2b),"When the restaurant is empty, telling me there wasn't enough staff is not a believable excuse. Especially when there were 4 staffers (one main waiter and helpers) for 16 people.Took 15 minutes after our burgers arrived and repeated questions to various staffers to get ketchup. Every bill came wrong. When they charged us $10 for a $7 glass of wine (we found out it should have been $6 for Happy Hour) they took $4 off the bill but they didn't recalculate the 20% gratuity that wasn't deserved or the tax. The food was pretty good. But when my husband and I ordered bacon cheeseburgers, we expected bacon. The waiter barely apologized and did not take anything off the bill for the error. But if I wanted to add bacon it would have cost at least $1 I am sure.Since The House is in my neighborhood I was excited to finally go - first and last time there I think."

And there is one- one that I actually saw on tv once!Thankfully it was Al's beef.Go up, order, and they call your order when it's ready.  I got a Big Al, w/cheese and hot peppers- dipped.  Also got a side of chili-chese fries.The place was big and clean, and of course, had the classic ""Welcome to Chicago"" slogan on the front door.  I couldn't imagine it any other way.The sandwich was literally the best I have had.  The bread was soaked but still held up as I chomped it.  The peppers were finely chopped and gave it a great flavor that I cannot compare it too.The only thing that prevented me from giving this place 5 stars was the huge Pepsi machine they had...I think too for the price, you get a great deal.The place isn't limited to beef, so keep that in mind if you are looking for something else to chomp on!"

ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324cc5),"Alas, my craving for Indian food came to the point where I had to breakdown and eat Indian food on the West Coast. :(  I'm sorry to say that my craving for Indian was not met and the ""timing"" to eat at ""Tandoori Times"" couldn't have been worse.To start off my first sign of disappointment was when I called to see if the had a lunch buffetThey didn't.  What Indian Restaurant doesn't do a lunch buffet!?Well two to be in exact, which happens to be the only two Indian restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale (Tandoori Times and Jewel of the Crown) which is where I work, of course.The cuisine...First off, I'm a big believer that you can judge an Indian restaurant by their chicken tikka masala, so since this was my first visit to Tandoori, I had to try it.   Let's just say it was okay at best.  The tikka masala was little bit spicier than usual, which is fine with me, and it also had the right consistency and richness from the cream you expect, but it missed the slight sweetness that contrasts the spices from the sauce.  Disappointing.Next was the naan.The naan came out warm and had that ever so slight crispy outside that I adore, but the inside was slightly doughy or little too moist, which made the naan slightly chewy after it cooled off.  It was still good, but come on; you can at least master the basics right?Wrong.Let's go to the rice.  First and foremost I don't ever recall where you had to pay for rice at any Indian restaurant.  Well guess what?  I did.  $2.50 to be exact!!!  And for $2.50, did they master this staple side dish?  Noooo...It wasn't like it was horrible but I have never had Indian rice that was oily; it was slight, but you could taste and feel it.  Overall texture and flavor was sub par, but I couldn't get over the slightly oily taste and texture.  All I could think was that I was eating Chinese fried rice (b/c of the oiliness) with my tikka masala.  Sigh... Oh well.  Atleast they gave a hearty portion.Decor was adequate, dark green and red colored sheer covered sections of walls and was used a divider to break up the room.  But what was up with the standard white office acoustical tiles in the ceiling?  Atleast black it out like most restaurants.  I felt like I was at work or in some weird episode of The Office.  An episode when Steve Carell's character, Michael, decides to go to an Indian restaurant at lunch and notices the same thing...but to only make an erroneous comment out loud so everyone in the restaurant could here, starts mocking Indians and their accent and everything then goes down hill: something I would only laugh if on TV, but would not in real life.  I couldn't get over the fact that on top of that they had the audacity to then painted random acoustical tiles dark red and blue, which made your eyes look up at the ceiling.  I'm clueless on that one.Anyways, I am very hard pressed to find a reason to go back Tandoori Times.  For all you Phoenicians you never had Indian Food, save your taste buds and go to NYC or anywhere back east and try it there.  But if you get the urge, I would suggest go to India Delhi Palace on McDowell Road.  The food is actually pretty good, for AZ standards that is.More along the lines of 2 1/2 Stars"

The style was perfect, the prices were not exorbitant, the food was delicious, the service was tremendous.We had a table at 7, and even though we Happy Hour had passed, they still let us order off of the happy hour menu, so we had four courses for $30 a piece.  We started with Spinach Artichoke DIp, each had a salad (I had the Bacon/Bleu Cheese/Walnut - YUM), then I had the Balsamic Ribeye...  It was so delicious.  One complaint, half of my steak was medium, a quarter was rare, and the other quarter was practically blue, but it still tasted great.  Oh - and the carrots were a little too sweet for me...  They tasted like sweet potatoes....Anyway...  For dessert we had the bread pudding which was the best damned bread pudding I have ever had.  Add in the drinks (which were tasty) and our bill was still nothing too crazy.Our server was just the right combination of hands off and hands on, and i dug her big time.  We ended up having a long leisurely meal, were there from 7-9, but it didn't feel like we were there a long time.  It was just a nice relaxing meal...Loved it - best restaurant experience I've had since I moved here three years ago.  Can't wait to go back."

We ordered the Eggs Benedict (a must try!!) and the Smoked Salmon to split, and some Truffle Fries to snack on while we waited for our food. The chef also sent out a giant Shrimp Cocktail for us to try as well; probably the best shrimp I have ever had. Cooked perfectly and a great salsa/cocktail sauce to go with. The Eggs Benedict were absolute perfection. No BS, couldn't have asked for them to have been better in any way; it is hard to paoch an egg to perfection and they nailed it.

They also have different food and drink specials advertised daily.The food is pretty good. I especially liked the chips and salsa. The chips were crispy and thin, while the salsa had a nice spicy flavor. I also tried a steak quesadilla. The meat had a great flavor, but the pieces were very tiny and there needs to be more.

ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56325141),"S has been on Yelp searching cool places for me to try during my visit here to the Phoenix area.Being away from home and wanting some comfort food, S suggested that I try Sake Bomber to get my sushi fix. The location was in close proximity to my hotel so I made arrangements for transportation to the restaurant. The staff at the front desk mentioned that the food there was pretty good.So, let's put that into perspective...I'm sure that there are many fine restaurants in the Phoenix area. When I'm visiting I love to experience restaurants (not chain) to get a taste of the local flavor. I'll have to say that SakeBomber is not the best representative of what Japanese food should be...I arrived during happy hour and the wait staff was very friendly and accommodating. I had imagined that I might be able to catch up on some reading while dining - but this was not the case. A patron of the restaurant, who thought he was being funny, was loud and demanding more drinks from the server. The dark interior, dim lighting and thumping music wasn't conducive to a serene dining experience. Oh well, I was here to get my sushi fix. I'm thinking that I shouldn't judge on appearances and maybe, just maybe, the sushi would redeem the thoughts that were going through my head.First came the gyoza and agedashi tofu. The gyoza was ok, but was very disappointed with the agedashi. I'm used to the agedashi dishes from Gombei or Hoshi's - piping hot chunks of creamy deep friend tofu, swimming in that wonderful sauce, covered with bonito flakes, grated ginger and radish. Instead I got chunks of barely warm firm tofu arranged on a platter with tempura sauce and sprinkled with a few green onions. I was hungry so, I ate it. I must admit that the salmon skin roll was the best deal of it all - 8 pieces of salmon skin nigiri with grilled asparagus and carrots. It was filling as well as yummy. I also had smoke salmon and hamachi maki. The fish was not the best I ever had, but I think that the sake I had during dinner helped the experience along with watching the snow boarding competition on the big screen TV behind the bar. I called the hotel shuttle to pick me up after dinner. I had to chuckle when the driver asked, ""How in the world did you end up at SakeBombers?""""You see,"" I told him. ""It was like this..."""

ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56325ae1),"If you are looking for service, this is definitely NOT the place to go. It definitely misses the concept of what a restaurant ought to be. The attitude and ambiance of what it means to sit in and dine at a restaurant is far below standard. We arrived at the restaurant with several empty tables. Seating took another 15 minutes. Once seated, we weren't served our drinks until after the tables that arrived after ours got theirs and neither was our order taken until after theirs even though I had notified our waiter that we were ready to order. I do not care if he is the owner's son but to hold such a pretentious attitude at a family owned restaurant is rather un-classy. I've withheld judgement the two previous times that I have visited the restaurant always giving the benefit of the doubt that they were just understaffed or there were too many customers. But, as a diner, I feel that there is just a certain number of bad quality treatment that a customer can take. Needless to say, we walked out after paying for our drinks. Needless to say, I won't be back. I much rather pay a premium and eat at Roka Akor or ShinBay than sit through mediocre sushi and poor service."

Even a year ago it had a decent crowd. When we arrived.. one table was sat with a child running and screaming through the dining area. Because of that we chose the bar. 2 guys at the bar that's it. Needless to say our service was good, how can it not be right? Started with BBQ shrimp.which was realy good but not BBQ, it was more of a spicy lemon, which was fine because the server explained that. Had I expected BBQ I would have been disappointed. Garlic Bread Great..Hush puppies a little over done but still good. Followed it up with the Bourbon Chocolate Sauce sundae..um yumm. So al in all food no complaints whatsoever. Atmosphere.. there was none. We might as well have been in a one horse town. While we were there the guys left and 2 business like women took their place at the bar. What was sad was the people watching. One of the women was just short of bragging how she used to go there all the time and how she knows all the employees...went out of her way to get the bartenders name and introduce herself like she was somebody. It was sad. She was name dropping herself! Food great.. atmosphere 'nil it was depressing..Its my opinion that unless they change up their location to something with more foot traffic (Mill Avenue would be perfect for this place... other spots such as Desert Ridge, Fashion Square, Westgate even..)they're going to waste away.

I ordered the Chitarra alla Carbonara with Guanciale. Man-o- man was it good. Thanks to Kevin H for my new found addiction; Guanciale! You Rule!  Now back to the review...If I were rating my entire experience on the pasta alone, you would see 5 stars. However, in order to get there I feel a few tweaks are needed to land on perfection. First, the local greens salad I had was way overly salted and a bit meager in my opinion. A little less on the salt and throw in a few shavings of Parmigiano and you got a winner. Second, I feel the pricing structure is little steep for the lunch crowd and may be the reason why my co-worker and I were the only ones in the place during the 11am lunch hour on a Tuesday. Consider a price adjustment to attract the lunch crowd and you're sure to draw them in.  My bill with tip was $24.66 for the salad, tea, and pasta. Lastly, and I second Alexander's plea. Where's the freaking bread!  I could not believe I had to give up my bowl with a pool of deliciousness still left at the bottom. The drippings alone could feed a family of three. It was criminal. I mentioned my disappointment to our server who kindly said there were no plans to serve bread with pasta dishes, the cracker sticks is all they were serving. Ditch the cracker sticks man and get with the program. I begged with him to make it happen and was a bit dramatic while conveying this request.  He must have got the message because 10 min later he came back to our table saying that the kitchen staff was working on a plan to serve bread with the pasta dishes.

ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b563253f6),"This is the kind of place where I thought about not writing a review, because I don't want to help it get too crowded.  I have had sushi in a variety of locations in the U.S., and outside of the U.S.  I am a sushi fan.  Fresh Wasabi Sushi and Grill doesn't have every sushi option in the book, but they have a very solid selection.  For what they have, THIS PLACE HAS 5 STAR SUSHI.The best part?  LOW PRICES!You may find a sushi restaurant out in Scottsdale, with a better sushi selection and slightly better sushi quality.  But you will pay 2-3 times the price.They do take out, provide outstanding service, the owner always goes out of his way to try and connect with all customers.  Impeccably clean.  Very happy with the seating layout, despite the smaller size.  Appropriate music played at an appropriate volume.  Kid friendly.  Great spot to take your family, or to have a date.  Probably want to keep a group at no more than 6 unless not a busy time."

Had a delicious wood fired oven pizza featuring Schreiner's Italian sausage, which I assume to be a local company.  It was fantastic, even the ricotta cheese, which I had been a bit leery of.  The rice pudding I had for dessert was spot-on also.  I also poached a couple of meatballs from someone's pasta plate and they were juicy, delicious and tender.  And I couldn't help but notice the pleasant and helpful staff.  Looking forward to a return trip to the Phoenix area."

The food is good, and they have fresh squeezed grapefruit juice...a must for a serious greyhound...but the service is ghastly.  The Duce is mostly counter service, but there are no signs indicating that, so customers are confused (which typically makes people uncomfortable).  The owners and people who work there will come up to you, but it's mostly to chatter or punch you in the shoulder, then they wander off.  There is no guidance about how to order or how things work.  It's as if you are in someone else's house and you don't know how to behave and your host is offering no guidance.  If fact, I think this is the primary issue...the owners run the Due like someplace they'd like to hang out, forgetting that their vision may not be intuitive to others.I've had a good experience with the food and the drinks, and I still think it is a cool hip space, but I find the service issues so disruptive that the Duce has dropped to my ""in a pinch, can't think of anyplace else to go with a group"" list, which is a bummer, because if this issue were corrected it could be a great hangout."

I had seen the cutesty little logos on the signs around the plaza, but for some reason just didn't feel compelled to walk over there.Well, last night, after craving pizza for several days, I made the very short trek over there.  I would have to say that I'm glad I did.  This pizza is great because it is thin crust and available in wheat- meaning you can make it semi-healthy!  I love that they have pretty much every option you can think of.  I went with a wheat crust pizza, pesto sauce, feta cheese, spinach and mushrooms.  They also can season your crust and pizza with a variety of flavorings (garlic, pepper, etc.).  The guy who helped me out was patient while I figured things out, and didn't seem annoyed in the least with my slowness.  Everyone working smiled at me and appeared to be happy to be there.My only complaint is that the prices seem a bit steep for what you're getting.  I realize that you get to choose whatever you want, but 75 cents for a topping on a personal size pizza seems a bit steep for me.  I walked out of here with my personal pizza and a pop that rang in at nine bucks.  Maybe I'm cheap, I don't know.  They do have happy hour specials from 4-7 so that might be a good thing to know (half off on some drinks and some appetizers).  There was a random band playing in there on the Thursday night I was in there, but I ended up taking out.  They have patio seating which is also a nice touch.I'll for sure be back for some (sort of) guiltless pizza and a glass of wine."

Due to what was apparently a miscommunication, CPH only wanted to allow our party to order from a set menu.  Many of us were not interested the set 4-course meal, and wanted food/drinks from the regular menu.  The management was not willing to allow this - since we didn't order from the fixed menu, they charged our group a $500 surcharge. So, CPH got $500 from our group (instead of the much larger fare had they allowed us to order from the normal menu.  But that will be the LAST penny CPH will ever see from me.  Saddle House, on the other hand, took great care of our large group at a moments notice.

I loved their chunky salsa though, which tasted very fresh. I was bummed that it took them nearly 10 minutes for them to refill my ice tea and it wasn't even that busy for a lunch hour.

ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56325065),"We tried out a nearby Pizza place tonight, Began's Classic Italian Pizza. It's tucked away in a dying strip mall on Baseline, west of McClintock. You really would need to know it's there to find it. I was expecting a strip mall kind of joint but was quite pleasantly surprised by the place. It's very nice, well decorated and perfect for a romantic dinner. They have an outside patio and seats at the bar in addition to ten or so tables inside. We split the Mediterranean Mix appetizer which was Feta Cheese, a selection of olives and a basket of warm, soft and tasty bread. It was a nice starter that we followed with the Diavola Pizza. That was topped by homemade Italian sausage, pepperoni, crushed red peppers, jalapenos, fresh mozzarella and tomato sauce. Really good!The pizzas are 12 inches so plenty for two. We actually only ate half of it and are saving the rest for breakfast. My friend enjoyed a nice glass of Chianti with her meal and they have a pretty good wine selection.The service was friendly and efficient. Our server told us they've been open for seven years. I can see why they've managed to do so despite the location.Total cost of our meal (I had water) was $31 which is a great value for the food quality, quantity and service."
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b5632370c),"Rock Bottom indeed. At least that is the level of service you can expect at this location.We went with our usual girls night out crew and sat outside on the patio. We sat for 15 minutes before a server even came over which was ok since we were chatting but we sure got thirsty. A server came over and asked if we had been helped yet and when we said no she said she was likely not going to be our server, but she'd take our drink order. Turns out, she was our server for the night. We could have done better serving ourselves at that rate. It took another 12 minutes to get our drinks. So yes, we were there 27 minutes before a beverage hit our table. Not a good start but this was my friend's choice as it was her birthday so I didn't complain.Ultimately, it took our party of 5 more than 2 hours to eat dinner at Rock Bottom. We had 3 different appetizers which we took advantage of the happy hour prices. We had to remind the server that we were to get the 1/2 price appetizers when she brought our check. We had to beg for refills of drinks, ask where our dinners were, and it was like pulling teeth to get service. The food was ok at best but really the service was so horrible that I wouldn't recommend this place to an enemy.  Save yourself the hassle. There are plenty of places who do want your business enough to treat you right. It's funny too because the place was packed. They won't be packed with us anymore. We dropped over $130 there. Never again."
ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b56324165),"After doing a little browsing in Old Town Scottsdale, we were feeling hungry, and my friend, who has not had Japanese food in years, wanted some. So I had my first sushi in the desert. Ra is the place in Old Town, so in we went. They have cheap specials on the lunch menu, along with a full complement of jive ass rolls, sashimi, sushi etc. I ordered beef teriyaki, my companion shrimp tempura, and as appys, I asked for a spicy scallop roll, fried soft shell crabs and seaweed salad.The crabs came out, 2 actually, for $9.75. Now that's a bargain! They were overly breaded, too thick a batter, which dampened the crab flavor, but it still tasted quite good. The seawed salad was abundant; I love seaweed, it seems such a direct and powerful way of communion with the ocean, a meaty plant. The spicy scallop hand roll was weak, the rice overcooked and the seaweed wrap, nori, rubbery, though the actual flavor of the scallop was good.As we waited for the main course, I looked around the room. It's quite a nice design, the sushi bar a large square in the center of the big room, the walls a mixture of stone and brightly red panels, with large red globe lamps hanging from the ceilings, bamboo also a prominent motif. The bar is at the entrance, and they seem to have an abundance of Happy Hour specials.Our friendly waitress brought us our bento box, and I was surprised at the size and variety of side items. Coles slaw, spring roll, potstickers, stir fry veggies and a salad to go along with a decent amount of beef teryiaki,  tender slices of beef with a good, warm slightly sweet flavor. The stir fry was overcooked, unfortunately, and the postsickers and spring roll were pretty conventional, and a little out of place. But a very cheap lunch at $7.75.This is a place that is about ""asian fusion"" for the American palate, apparently a chain with outlets in several states, so one accepts the concept, albeit reluctantly. It's not terrible, just homogenized, but I don't get how an ""asian"" restaurant can overcook veggies and turn out such a subpar hand roll. Rubbery nori? That's inexcusable.2.5 starssee pix posted"

Yet the first time we ate at this Grimaldi's, we were blown away!  Upon entering, you are enveloped by the aroma of pizza baking in a coal-fired oven.  This is swoon-inducing---and I mean that in a good way.  The smell almost has you believing that you are in a pizza joint with a coal-fired oven in the Northeast.When ordering pizza baked in a coal-fired oven, I like to get a plain cheese pizza.  IMO, this is the best way to fully taste the sauce, cheese and crust without anything else get in the way.  There's nothing like a thin crust pizza from a coal-fired oven with that char on the crust.  The crust has just the right balance of crispy and soft.  The sauce is well flavored with proper proportions of basil and oregano.  The amount of cheese is just right.  I love to savor each and every bite.There is more to this Grimaldi's than the one under the Brooklyn Bridge.  This one has other items in addition to the pizza.  We like their antipasto.  It has sliced mozzarella which is fresh and creamy, black and green olives (the black ones are pitted, the green ones have pits in them),  roasted red pepper slices which are bursting with flavor, and a good, flavorful salami.Everytime we're in AZ, it is so worth it to us to deal with the heavy traffic in Old Town Scottsdale to dine at Grimaldi's!"

Other burgers at our table received good reviews, with the exception of the fried onion topping.  It was over-fried, to the point of tasting burned (and not in a good bruleed way).  I was disappointed that their french fry seasoning contains gluten, and the portion was pretty small.  This is not a side to share with a friend.  They also seemed like they had been cooked from frozen, and not fresh.  Favorite part of the meal? Milkshakes.  I had some questions about the milkshake ingredients, and was a bit skeptical when they told me their recipe... but dang.  That was a reeeeaaallly good strawberry milkshake.  The marshmallow milkshake was also delish, with lots of frozen bits of marshmallow fluff floating through it.

ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b563247b0),"Full review blogged:Crostini di Fegatini alla Fiorentina:  $5. Nothing complicated here, just rough ground chicken liver pate over homemade toasted bread with a bit of parsley.  Served chilled and ample in portion, no complaints.Maialino:  $18.  The most limited item on the menu this spit-roast baby piglet was gone by the time we left and although the skin could have been crispier the flavors were spot on - the pork supple and rife with notes of garlic, rosemary, coriander, and pepper while the skin was slightly sweet and plenty smoky.Panino con Porchetta: $8.95. Much like the Maialino this could have used a bit more crackle on the surface but all things being equal it would be pretty hard to complain about crusty Italian bread wrapped around warm pork roast with plenty of black pepper, fennel and light citrus notes.Baccala` in Umido con Polenta: $18. One of my primary reasons for wanting to visit Andreoli in the first place was this dish and thankfully it did not disappoint one bit.  Big in portion, huge in flavor, and in my opinion the most well executed dish of the afternoon I figured going into it that the cod would be excellent and as good as it was, the biggest shocker of the dish was perfect execution of the polenta - toothsome, dense, and a veritable sponge for both the tomatoes and the briny fish.Caponata Sicula: $5. Simple, savory, and perhaps the deal of the day this plate of tender eggplant, briny capers, pine nuts, tomatoes, balsamic, and olive oil with hints of basil and onion was plenty to share and would have only been better with some warm bread for dipping.Trippa alla Toscanaccia: $14. With almost half of our table having never eaten tripe and another not really a fan of the dish I figured I'd be doing most of the legwork on this dish and although everyone took a taste my suspicions fortuitously proved correct - an acquired taste for sure, this was really good.  Thin like soup and plenty fatty despite being loaded with meat with notes of onion, tomato, and vinegar at the fore while mint and garlic came through on the palate this was another place that some extra bread would have been welcomed as far too much broth remained at the end.Mille Feuille: $7. While I contest this should have been referred to as a Napoleon I guess it really doesn't matter because regardless of nationality what we received was flaky pastry wrapped around lightly sweetened pastry cream.  Clearly not as transcendent as some of the a la minute options being turned out elsewhere as this one had been stored in the chiller all day I have to say I was largely impressed by the separation of the layers and lack of sogginess.Rhum Baba: $2 each.  Also straight from the chilled case these traditional baba were everything one could hope from the classic dish - a buttery ball of pastry drown in rum; a sledgehammer of flavor up front with a buttery sweet finish; at one bite each I'm pretty sure I'd have been tipsy with a half dozen.Struffoli: $4.  Another very traditional selection you don't really see all that often at Italian markets or bakeries these marble sized pastry balls were crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and absolutely dredged in honey.  A stark textural juxtaposition to the baba which was soft throughout I personally enjoyed these a lot, though having sat for a while the honey had begun to harden which made them a bit difficult to extract from the small dish.Cornetti: $2.50.  Golden crisp on the outside, buttery caverns within, and fortunately a brand new batch when I ran back in to make my purchase this warm nutella croissant was the highlight of the sweets for me - a strong contender for best croissant in town that remained fluffy despite the chocolate-hazenut filling while the exterior shattered to the tooth.Sfogliatelle: $3.  Lightly citrus thanks to the use of candied lemon peel, even crispier than the cornetti on the outside, and a pillow of ricotta smoothness within - if you go to Andreoli and don't order one of these you're missing out...as a matter of fact, I'd go so far as to suggest that this item alone is worth a visit to Andreoli as it was every bit as good as any I've ever tasted on either coast (admittedly having not yet been to Italy.) Schiacciata uva: $4.  I'd never tried this prior to Andreoli's and, as a matter of fact, I'd never even seen it.  Quite simply a focaccia base with fresh grapes placed at the center prior to baking thus allowing the juices to infuse the dough as it cooked this was sweet, light, and full of flavor - the sort of dish that would be easy to whip up for a party and equally easy to dress up in any number of variations.The Verdict:  Fresh, rustic, and very authentic this one definitely goes on the 'under the radar' list and while I'm unable to speak to Andreoli's quality during normal business hours I can only say that based on what I experienced at the Christmas festival I'm eager to return."

You couldn't ask for a better location for Old Town Scottsdale. After chowing down at Distrito and having a drink or two at Old Town Whiskey, you're walking distance from two of my favorite Scottsdale drinking holes: AZ88 and Old Town Tavern.The rooms are an interesting mish-mash of retro and functional/minimalist modern that works really well and makes for a comfortable stay. White walls contrast with vibrant purples and pinks; colored wood furnishings contrast with stainless steel and modern black and white photos along with old Arizona Highway magazines and other furnishings and accents from yesteryear adorn the rooms. My suite had an awesome huge bathroom with cool toiletries;  my bedroom had a comfy king bed;  and a spacious double patio was accessible from the bedroom and the living room. The Saguaro also passed the test by having iPod docs in the bedroom....and necessity in my book! We spent Sunday by the pool in a cabana. Needless to say we were very well looked after by the wonderful staff as a DJ cranked out some awesome tunes and we frolicked in the pool.definitely a party atmosphere and a FANTASTIC day!My stay at the Saguaro was really great and i would recommend this property to anyone who wants to have a good time in Scottsdale and stay in a hip, cool property and still have some money to spend on drinks. The staff are all great and ready to help ensure your stay is great. They really took great care of us.P.S. nice job on the purple carpet walkways throughout the hotel!!!!"
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b563252a3),"I don't care much for Basha's and I really can't stand Food City (see Phoenix Ranch Market), but AJ's is how the Basha family does it right.  My friend Bobo and I didn't even flinch yesterday when our total for two ribeye steaks, asparagus spears and corn cobs came out to nearly $50, because we knew we were getting high-quality grub.I don't come here often these days, probably because I used to come here all the time when I dated some pretentious A-HOLE a while back who preferred AJ's at all costs.  But I do come here when I prepare for dinner parties I'm hosting, go to brunches or just want to feel nostalgic for Bristol Farms and Gelson's from back home.You can never go wrong with ANY of their food whether its croissants or desserts from their boulangerie (which is French for ""I'm a fancy bakery you can't afford, you chump""), the butcher block, pizza counter or cheese deli.But my absolute favorite part about AJ's is their wine selection and florist area.  I was gratifyingly reassured when I showed up to the home of Kristin S one day with the same exact cava, that lo and behold, we both religiously drink.  And when you're on the run you can always be sure they will have a trained wine sommelier help you in a pinch and chill a bottle for you in minutes.If you're looking to be romantic and get laid, this is a one-stop shop with the fresh fruit salad in the deli case, cheeses, wine, chocolate selection, flowers all under one roof -- plus Castle Boutique is just one block over.  Score!"

ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324aad),"Well we went on opening weekend and went very late.  I was hoping for breakfast around 11pm.  Despite advertising that they were open and doing regular business, when we got there and got seated, the waiter told us that it was a limited menu.  No big deal, I get it, but lame.So we order a couple drinks, some mini hot dogs, and a burger to share.The drinks were a DISASTER.  I don't think I've ever had a worse drink.  $13 for a tiny glass of vodka and muddled fruit.  No flavor, no sugar, no nothing.  Just straight vodka and fruit.  This is the most expensive drink I've ever seen on a menu and it is worthless.  I can get a damn flaming volcano of rum that has enough booze to knock two of me out for $15 at Hulas...so explain your pricing scheme to me - please.The mini hot dog things were good.  Nothing special about them, but they were okay.The burger was giant and pretty good.  It had some massive pieces of bacon on it and was cooked really well.I am still willing to go back for breakfast one of these days but for the $40 a dropped there, I really didn't get much out of it.  The service was painfully slow and the menu was overpriced.  Welcome to Scottsdale, I guess."

I am very pleased with it. This particular location has that outpost/trader store look and feel. They are basically a mini version of Whole Foods or Sprouts minus all the fancy extras and a lower cost. I love the options. The sparkling mineral water for $.99. The Olive Oil for $4.99. The curry simmer sauce for $2.29. The ground turkey for $3. Organic foods at average prices. I am  not sure how they do it, but it seems to be working and I think it is wonderful. I cannot wait till this store hits Texas. I know it will be a hit. Hell it would almost be worth living in Phoenix just to have Trader Joe's and Total Wine. LOL"

And it's heaven.  The service at Dukes is friendly and attentive, they have good bar food, and a bloody mary station to get you going in the mornings.  They have more tvs set up than you could possibly ever need, with multiple rooms that cut you off from the main bar area so you or a group can watch your own game on a big screen with volume.  It's a real sports bar that knows how to run it's tvs and put the best games on.  They have multiple pool tables, buck hunter and shuffle board."

They came here because, like me, they read a review for this place posted earlier today. Because it was lunchtime, the place was busy, but the line moved quickly enough and the people taking the orders were friendly. I enjoyed the baconburger I ordered - quite a stack, with crispy bacon, two patties, plus the condiments I ordered (lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup, mustard), and the fries were great - thicker than at most places, adequately salted, and a nice balance of softness and slight crispiness. Plenty of places to sit, especially since they have a nice patio for al fresco dining ... and don't forget to serve yourself with the peanuts in the shell to munch on while waiting for your number to be called."

Thanks Gabby for getting this little get together to happen! Also want to say Thank you to Kelly, our wonderful server! She was full of information and didn't seem bothered by our questions! Even the owner stopped by our table to say hi and see how things were going with us.  Yelp ordered appetizers for all us to try, there was Croquetas De Jamon (ham croquettes), Yuca Frita ( fried yuca wedges) Tostones (twiced fried green plantains), Empanadas De Carne (dough shells with beef), Papas Rellenas (potato rounds with beef in the center & breaded & fried), Tamal Cubano (Cuban style tamel), Mariquitas (homemade plantain chips). What a delight to be able to try everything, I would have never know what to order on my own, but now I feel confident in what to order , all though all the apps were delish, my favs where the Papas Rellenas, Mariquitas and the Yuca Frita, yea I can see me coming back for those!For the main dish I ordered the #403 Pollo Deshebrado, which was shredded chicken with garlic, onions & bell peppers in a tomato sauce served with yellow rice, black beans and sweet plantains, when you order the dish with the yellow rice, the black beans do not come with but you can add them for buck, that my friend was worth it! I love black beans, unfortunately one of my daughters has a allergic reaction to them, so I never have them in the house, so for just a buck I said add them babies!  The chicken was moist, tender, so full of flavor, I was stuffed and still kept eating the dish! The rice was perfect and mixed with the black beans, that right there was sweet heaven!Thanks again to Gabby and the Yelp International Supper Club gang; it was great food, great company & conversation, look forward to trying out another new place next month!"

ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324ab5),"I just keep going back!!! If you want the best burger, best service, nicest people. This is the place to go. Now I have not tried everything on the menu (Yet). But I am trying. We go there almost weekly to see what is new. I always ask Steve what I should try this trip. He never steers me wrong. Their burgers are not just burgers like you get in most places. They are what you would call a work of art the way they combine different tastes. You can go many places to get a hamburger but you will not find a better burger or sub anywhere. On top of this you will be greeted  by the nicest group of people in the valley. THIS PLACE IS MY ATF (all time favorite).Keep it up Rocket Burger. Can't wait to see what is new."
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323f22),"I saw this coffee shop the last time I went to Zen32 and it worked out to where I was meeting a friend for coffee and since we both live on opposite sides of the valley, Hava Java ended up being a nice and central location. I'm not sure if it's a chain store but it has an independent coffee shop feel which is pretty cool now days. The coffee tasted good and they seem to take the art of espresso seriously with the only knock being they do not roast the beans locally. When: Saturday Afternoon at 4:30 pmLocation: As stated in opening description it's a great central location to meet people but since it's in the same shopping center as a bank, Zen32, Safeway, Gelato, and other little shops parking was tight. (If you're a grumpy driver you will need to bring your patience along for parking). The one thing I noticed was the Gelato store next door. I would think on a hot summer day if you're a coffee fanatic it would be nice to have your coffee then enjoy some Gelato. Front and back patio seating, free wifi, Ambience: Hava Java has the obvious local art hung throughout the place. It's a little place so the walkways are very narrow and the  high tables are barley functional, and if you sit in the back you can smell the restroom. The best place to sit is out front or out back. I really liked the fact they have a back patio seating area. That's unique for a coffee shop. Coffee: I had 2 drinks: a vanilla latte and a coffee. Above average taste and presentation but it's not elite. The staff was proactive in asking my milk preference. The coffee came in a to-go cup and not a ceramic cup in case you care about that.  If you are a serious coffee connoisseur you may not like Hava Java due to the fact the beans are not as fresh as they could be if bought from a local roaster. Food: They offer the typical pastries. I didn't ask where they buy from but it looks like the typical Chompies verity. I didn't have anything to eat. Price: Average: My small vanilla latte was about 3.50. My large coffee was 2.00Clientele: Since it's in the Biltmore area its typical upper middle class people in there late 40s/50s. The one thing I found a bit odd was that the customers were overly friendly, it was a little unnerving but that could have been just me so I'm not knocking them for that. Wait: There was not a line when I arrived so they prepared my order immediately. Staff: They had one girl working when I arrived and she was really nice and professional. No face tattoos or odd piercings. Not that tattoos and piercing bother me but at some coffee shops that is the typical staff look and it might bother others."

So, first their take-out process: they've never botched an order, food has been ready within the time frame given each and every time, and I'm almost always in and out in a flash. The food: I've sampled various veggie and seafood options, and they've all been equally delicious. Since I've never been inside for more than a few minutes, I can't really vouch for the atmosphere or the service, but I stand by the food. A little pricier, perhaps, than the Thai Basil down the street, but totally worth it."

But after reading some pretty good reviews on Yelp, I knew I just had to find out for myself! After biting the bullet on the $24 price tag for the crab cake dinner I was presented with a plate of pure heaven on earth. Two 2oz crab cakes made from 100% JUMBO lump Maryland Blue Crab drizzled lightly in a homemade remoullade, with a side of potatos and asparagus! Theses crab cakes are the real deal!

Yes, ""Beef Noodle Soup"".  I forgot I'm in N. Scottsdale where culture can be lacking at times.  I'll have me a bowl of Asian man soupy stuff and some noodles - wink! I also ordered some ice coffee with condensed milk - can't have Pho without one of these drinks. Overall, the Pho is okay. I'm somewhat of a Pho Nazi and this didn't really past the test.  My ice coffee was excellent - Why?  It was served just right!  Not too strong and not too lite.  I'm really used to having it strong and simmering it off with some water to weaken it.

It felt less like a chain laid out for maximum amount of getting people in and out and more like a place that was made in homage to good food where you could sit and have a nice long meal. We went there after the food network special and got the bolognese - it was really delicious. The food isn't too expensive, it's all the add-ons. When you go there you just can't help order an appetizer, a meal, a bottle of wine AND dessert. It's totally worth a visit if you haven't been yet!"

ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b563255b8),"I'm not sure why I'm bothering to review Fate myself, since dozens of other people have already done so. I guess it's because I've become a little disillusioned with the place.My husband and his friends have come here all the time for years. Often, they bring me, and I love the food. The tofu is always perfectly crispy, the dishes (especially the chow fun) are excellent and the drink menu is fun and creative.So why 3 stars?Simply, this place has developed a really bad attitude. Fate is like that friend in middle school who suddenly decided she was ""too cool"" for you, and started moving away from  you at the lunch table and then sabotaging your cheer leading routines.Last time we came here, the bar next door to it had just opened -- so we made some allowances for slowness -- but STILL. We made reservations and still had to wait an hour. That's ridiculous. Then we had just purchased expensive drinks and were not allowed to bring them to the restaurant. No apologies, nothing.That particular night, after an hour, we were still table-less and  about to leave, as we had seen plenty of couples who were apparently *friends* with the waitstaff (and who had come much later than we had) get seated, while we waited... and waited.. .and waited... Finally, the owner of the restaurant saw us complaining, recognized my husband's friend, and found us seating.Now, a few days ago, we called to make reservations and dared to ask if they had something earlier than 9:30. What did we get? A snappy, smart ass response.No thanks, Fate. There are plenty of other places opening up downtown and we'll start to take our business there. I love what you're doing to downtown Phoenix, but that slowly swelling head on your shoulders isn't attractive."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324930),"This place is a hit or miss. Hence why I would rate it as average.  I've been here so many times for lunch because it's so close to work and because coworkers would suggest it.  I've had all the curries and every time the spiciness is different even though I ask for a 3.  Sometimes it's not spicy at all and sometimes it's so spicy that my mouth burns.  I've had the eggplant with chicken, but the chicken isn't as moist and tender as I hoped meat would taste like. They chopped up the chicken in very small pieces and seemed overcooked.  I would stick with the different types of curries (red, green, yellow) though.  It's safer.  The curry sauce would seep into the meat and make it more tender. The curries can also be different textures.  I've had it where it's thick and creamy (the way I like it) or more watered down.  The lunch portions are pretty small, but I guess it's enough for a lunch meal.  Beware Swaddee's if you're not too comfortable with spicy.  Just order a lower number and you can add more chili if it's not spicy enough for you.  I still would recommend this place and try your luck with the food here.  You may get lucky and have a great meal."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324c12),"This place is fantastic.About the restaurant itself.  It's right by downtown Phoenix, and in fact right next to a Light Rail stop--so keep this in mind, parking is metered and sometimes hard to come by easily, if you live by a light rail this may be the smarter option.  The place is seriously tiny, only about 6-8 groups of people can be seated at one time.  A slight drawback is that there is limited outdoor seating, which, given the predictably large lines even on weekdays, is a problem.  The Phoenix sun will make a 45 minute wait seem like an hour and a half wait.Now about the service.  I've always had a good experience with the people who work here.  The first time I came here, apparently one of the owners saw that I looked lost, because she came out and very kindly explained how people are seated, where I can go to get coffee in the meantime.  She even suggested I leave my cell phone number and she'll call me when my seat is ready, in case I'm shopping for example.  The waitresses always serve us quickly and never leave us hanging, and they're always smiling, which for some reason makes the experience so much better.Now for the best part.  I swear, they put crack in their food, because although their breakfast options are simple, they are out of this world.  The first time I came here I got the waffles.  Perhaps it's because they use REAL maple syrup, or all of the ingredients are organic and locally grown, but they make the best waffles I've ever had.  I don't even know how one makes a good waffle really, it seems pretty formulaic, but it's stellar.  I ordered it with bacon, which was also wonderful--the bacon used was the good stuff, not the excessively fatty bacon you buy at the supermarket.  Every bite is spectacular, and when you're done, you're full, but not the kind of full you'll often get at breakfast joints where you think you're going to explode or take a nap--full, but refreshed.The second time I came I got the pancakes.  Not the best pancake I've ever had, but still, superb and the real maple syrup just sends it through the roof.  The third time I went I got the waffle again (see above).Before I came here, I was excited about leaving Phoenix for New York due to the incredible array of dining options you get in that city.  Now I'm worried there won't be anything as good!"

This place is the place I go to when I want to thank my taste buds for doing their job 24/7!So far I have been there two times with some friends, and each time I went I felt like it was Thanksgiving all over again: trying to fit just another delicious bite of food before heading home. A doggie bag / box is a disgrace to the food! Both times I have been there I have had the prix fixe menu with the twin steak medallions with blue cheese and port demi-glace. It's amazing! The blue cheese works well with the demi-glace with a mix of sweet and tangy-creamy tastes as the opening gig, followed by the main show of the amazingly tender and slightly bloody steak. This was one of the only places I have been to that cooks the steak rare plus, which provides all the melt-in-your-mouth goodness with a lot less blood that rare sometimes gives. The soup is always great, the first time I had lobster bisque, second time I had vegetable and hearty chunks of bacon. They always supply you with a fresh loaf of sourdough bread, crusty on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside: perfect for sopping up the soup!As for the dessert, I can't get over how awesome the cr??me br?¿l??e is! It is about the size of a small football, and around 1.5 inches deep. Simply divine! Both times I have been to Donovan's the servers worked as a team and introduced themselves as such. We had three people attending to our needs, and everything was brought out speedily including some samples of the sides. Never had such great service, it seems like they weren't competing for tips, leaving a table belonging to another server to hang out and dry just because it wasn't there's. It was very refreshing to know that at all times someone was looking out for you.Finally, the happy hour here is the best I have ever been to! From 4-8 you can get 7 dollar cocktails and martinis that are very good for the money, although at normal price I would shy away from the drinks. Not only can you get half price drinks, from 4-6 you also can have all the prime rib sandwiches you can eat. Mini sandwiches filled with tender prime rib, dripping with cheese, with grilled onions and mushrooms rounding out this complimentary wonder of the world! I may have not been to as many higher end steak places as some of my fellow yelpers, but I do suggest you give this place a try!"
ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b56324609),"This is now one of my favorite places in Tempe.  It is definitely a hidden gem.  Don't judge this place by any other criteria than the taste and quality of the food, although my pork tenderloin could have used a bit more seasoning (salt).  Just, honest, fresh, tasty food.  Menu options that will satisfy many food preferences including vegetarian and gluten-free.  And, it will not leave a huge dent on your wallet.  Don't expect service to be comparable to ""pro"" run restaurants.  It is a very small (seats less than 30) independently owned and, I believe, family run.  They are very friendly and accommodating.  Leave your pretensions at the door and you will have a great experience."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b5632495f),"First off, let me say that I live almost across the street from here and have been waiting for a grocery store downtown for almost 5 years.  I was there the very first day they were open and have been back three or four times since.  I waited to write my review until they had their ""grand opening"" and until they had gotten into the groove of having a market.Boy, where do I start with the complaints?  The biggest complaint is not so much the hours but the DAYS that they are open.  Maybe I'm weird but I do my grocery shopping on Sunday.  We specifically didn't get a few things from F&E because we wanted the ones from the market.  I try and go Sunday but they are closed.  Try and go back Monday...they are closed.  At this point, I really need those items and I'm just going to buy them from a normal store.  It doesn't make any sense why you would have a ton of vendors there on Saturday dropping off their goods only to have them sit, locked up, until Tuesday.  If you need two days off, take Saturday and Wednesday off when the outdoor market is in full swing.My next complaint is the selection.  I'm not even going to complain that you don't have basic things like fruit or butter.  I'm going to complain that you carry fish from Alaska (not local) and that you carry Shamrock milk! WTF! You could be carrying SuperFarm milk, butter, and ice cream but instead you carry the same thing Target has.  Try supporting real local business instead of mega-giant Shamrock Farms.Finally, what's with the ""wine bar""?  Is it actually somewhere in the building or am I supposed to sit in the middle of the produce and drink?

ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323f70),"I had been looking forward to trying Camus' successor for a couple of months, and finally go the chance to on recent Friday night.We had a large group of about 12 or 15, five or so of which arrived about 15 minutes early. So we ordered drinks in the bar area which had some seemingly graffiti-type art that seemed totally out of place in this hip, downtown hotel lounge/restaurant. We mentioned in passing to a waitress that we were here to give someone a head's up and she looked physically sick as she sighed, ""Oh, you're the large party? Yeah, I have you."" Well, that's not the way to start things off, that's for sure.I totally felt for her - at first. Large groups are very intimidating to serve. Except... the rest of the restaurant was virtually empty. I could go into a laundry list of things she messed up, forgot or simply did not know, but I think J-Man S. already pointed most of them out for us (and that was only our side of the table...)So, on to the food. I was *starving* so I ordered a bowl of $4 miso soup to hold me over until my burger arrived (had I been less starved, I would have ordered the tofu curry or been more adventurous, but all I could think about was grilled animal flesh). Ok, so it took about 40 minutes to get the apps out - seriously? Anyway, I thought RA had, hands down, the worst miso soup, but this place takes the cake. Yeah, it's only 4 bucks, but I was *so* bummed when it finally came out that it was lukewarm and had the consistency of gravy, was flavorless and had not a single vegetable or piece of tofu in it. REALLY?!After an extended conversation with the server about the cheeses offered for the burgers, mine still came out cheese-less...sigh. I had to *send it back* even though I knew it would take anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes for the corrected meal to come out (her average time for fixing her many, many screw ups). Once I finally had my plate, I found that the fries were shockingly still hot - and pretty damn good, too. Too bad the ""house fries"" that were supposed to be a mix of sweet potato and regular were all regular save for two. The burger was also pretty good...but to give a back-handed compliment, burgers are hard to mess up and at that point, the napkins looked delicious.I did sample Bonnie's tofu curry and thought it was pretty good - the tofu was crispy and the curry sauce seemed flavorful...but I don't trust my opinion at this point because I might have eaten anything. The serving of chicken teriyaki could have fit in a tuna can - sad, sad, sad.On top of that, after an unsatisfying meal, I trekked to the bathroom. I was surprised to find it was filthy and completely out of paper towels and soap. Iiiickkkk. Now that's just unacceptable for a place that charges $12 for a drink. You couldn't pay me to go back to C4 - if they can't even keep the bathrooms clean, I can't imagine what the bar or kitchen looks like."
ObjectID(5165b71d74c3068b56325ec7),"For an early lunch around one this place was near empty. Our waitress took her sweet time and the greek salad was drenched in dressing, other than that the rest of the food was great. Prices are higher than some chains, but cheap for this part of town.I don't understand how they can charge $5 for a bowl of soup, and then $4 for a cup? You'd think it'd be a bigger difference."

Its too bad that we wont get to experience their services because of the owner.  The owner may know how to light up an open sign, hire great employees, and set a great atmosphere... but she lacks class and needs to know what customer service stands for.  Im all about supporting small business and local businesses at that... but I will not support a classless piece of trash.  We were regulars there bringing in friends family and referring this place to anyone we could.  I will never go there again and dont think it is appropriate to treat customers the way she did us.  Not only did she eavesdrop on our quiet conversation, but then she butts in to tell us that we are being rude talking about how we disagree about her not advertising that only the 1st bottle is half off wine night but fails to tell us until after we have ordered 2 bottles.  Common courtesy would have been to tell us that the 2nd bottle is only $5  off when we ordered the 2nd bottle.... not wait til we question later and she wants to point to the menu stating the fine print says otherwise.  Im sorry, but i didnt look at a menu to look for the fine print when i see your Half off bottle wine night posted all over facebook.  But besides the fact,  after the disagreement, she proceeds to tell us that if we dont like it, we can leave.  Fair enough.....  let us finish our wine we bought and we will never be back.  She then threatens to call the cops if we dont leave that moment.  Unnecessary!  we werent causing a scene.  She made the scene on her own.  I will take my group of 7 that visits there 2-3 times a week and support another business.

ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56325aeb),"The place is well managed and its owner cares.  He'd once owned the 5&Diner chain in the valley here, so good old fashion experience is at work here.  I can see a few Indulge Burgers dotted around our valley one day.We had burgers, fries, hot wings, and mac & cheese.  The beef was just okay and seemed over worked and could have used a bit of seasoning.  I ordered our burgers medium rare, but both came out well; so that was a little disappointing.  Well done burgers aren't a deal breaker, but just not as pleasurable to me.  Our fries were hot and very good.  The mac & cheese was good and not overcooked the way most serve it, though it did need salt.  It was very bland before adding a little salt, so keep this in mind if you try it.I have to say though, each time I've tried the wings, they were not so good.  They taste twice cooked and have what I describe as a ""refrigerator taste"".  I'd later found out that they bake them halfway and refrigerate till ordered.  The cooks pull out handfuls to be quickly fried the rest of the way and serve them up as fresh.  The bones have white spots as anyone who's reheated wings at home the next day has experienced.  The wings were dry and overcooked, so I frankly wouldn't order them expecting wings such as you get at Rehab Burger Therapy (which are freaking awesome).  The hot sauce was your standard Franks hot sauce and nothing special.  I had hoped for something a bit more homemade and spicier, but hey.I'd only suggest that they go a little further in keep things fresh and improve what they are currently doing, because garnishing with limp hot lettuce, a single soggy pickle, and sprinkling carrot shavings is neither necessary nor edible.The owner whom you may get to meet and are free to ask for should you so wish, and their wait staff were just great.  They are good reasons for returning.  The bars specials are well thought out and tailored to local tastes.  Perfect pours and quick refills are the norm.  So my main grips were seasoning (fixable my anyone at the table), overcooked burgers (training through experience rectification), and only 1 star reduction for what I dub wing wrong (say that 5x fast).  I'd honestly give Indulge 4 out of 5 hopeful stars."

The minute you enter The Skeptical Chymist, traditional apothecary items originally purchased in Ireland surround you.  Dark wood surrounds your every turn, even a side room named after the pub's namesake book written by Robert Boyle of Cork, Ireland.  The 1627 book written by Robert Boyle, became the foundation for modern day chemistry.  I have always found Irish pubs in America tie a great story related to an Irish native or product from Ireland. Their menu includes appetizers, flatbread sandwiches, soups and salads, burgers, entrees and a small dessert selection.  Irish entr??e specialties include Real Lamb Shepherd's Pie, Corned Beef and Cabbage, and Fish & Chips.Their Fish & Chips platter ($14.00 dinner portion) includes a large piece of battered cod, along with French fries, tangy coleslaw and tartar sauce.  Their fish is fried and tastes delicious, especially with malt vinegar drizzled generously on top.  Their fries are ample, lining the whole entire plate under the large piece of cod.  You find a hint of garlic within this combination of soft and crispy fries.  Their entr??e items can be paired with other sides including, scalloped potatoes, green beans, salad, cole slaw or their soup of the day. Accompanying the fish and chips, their Lost Coast Brewery IPA (which was a special of the day) is a red bitter brew, but a bitter that grows less with each taste.  If a red brew is not for your choosing, you can select one of their many draft beers available as well as wine by the glass.  They offer a happy hour each day from 4-7 p.m., $2.00 off their beer and wine.The Skeptical Chymist brings a touch of Ireland, both in atmosphere and food.

I went with the roasted chicken pizza, and it was topped with Gorgonzola, Parmesan Onions, Apricots and Aileen went with the four cheese pizza.  The pizza came out piping hot and was tasty.

When it came to the drink, the man started off by preparing our espresso shots, drizzled the chocolate syrup into our cups then poured a measurement of soy milk into the cup. While the espresso was brewing he took his time carefully stirring the chocolate into the milk. He then poured the espresso into the mixture and again slowly stirred it for a period of time. He then topped it off with ice and a little more soy milk and voila. The best iced soy mocha latte I have ever had. The crepe? pretty fantastic too!

Being from the South, it wasn't thrilling that the biscuits were somewhat small and square shaped, almost like a little dinner roll.  They have their own style (and they've informed me that they are homemade) but I was looking for something more substantial to be smothered in sausage gravy.  The pancakes were not served hot with the other food items, and they seemed to have settled and were somewhat chewy and elastic.Menu was rather straightforward and clear with sectioned boxes, with a nice highlight of their featured stuffed apple pancake.

But it usually always comes down to that I make a killer chili dog at home that no one could mess with and besides why would I pay someone for something I could do myself. Well, I finally gave in and gave Maui Dog a try based on some of the yelps. The location used to be a cheese steak joint and isn't the sleekest building on the block but who are we kidding, we only come for the food right? I ordered a Hana dog volcanic style (hotter mayo sauce), a spam slider Maui style (sweet with pineapples and stuff), and a side order of fries. The meal came out to over 10 bucks with a tip. The slider had a quarter inch thick slice of spam, which, I haven't had in about 15 years. The spam was on a sweet roll with a bunch of the toppings listed. It was good but not great. I am not a fan of sweet stuff to begin with but then it just kind of fell flat. I would recommend not getting it Maui style. Maybe it would be better if it was spicy. Or if they would sear the spam and give it a slight burnt/rcrisp coat it could be much better. The Hana dog was masterfully created. Absolutely delicious. Nice big dog, buried in bacon, avocado, pico, cilantro, on a sweet bun and the volcanic sauce was money. I will most definitely attempt to recreate this beast at home. The fries were very weak. They were soggy and filled with oil. The kind that your mom would attempt to make at home instead of the fast food version you wanted. I would suggest making them crispier and adding some seasoning. The man at the counter was as friendly as they come. He even came out and was checking everyone and how they were doing. He recommended adding some ghost powder to make the Hana dog even hotter. I may take him up on that. The bill was a bit much for the product. It came out to over 10 bucks with a tip. For a gourmet hot dog, a slider, and potato a 10 spot is a little excessive. However, with that being said, the dog was delicious and the guy at the counter provided excellent service so I would consider going back on that alone. At this point I recommend skipping the fries and slider altogether and sticking to the dogs."

I just sat and looked at mine. ""Fourteen dollars for this? How much was yours, eleven dollars?"" My boyfriend looks at my plate and could only say, ""That's it?"" He received a FULL plate of meatloaf and the other half of mashed potatoes. I had six stalks of asparagus and a piece of fish the size of a child's hand. That was it. I called the waiter over and asked him if all the fish were this size and he said he thought so and there was nothing wrong with my meal. I asked him if this was worth $14 to him and he said he thought so. I told him, ""I'm not from Scottsdale, I would like to see the manager."" The manager walks over and proceeds to actually argue with me about the food saying that it is perfectly fine. I said, ""It may be fine, it may taste great, but I'm still going to be hungry after this $14 meal. I would at least like another piece of fish."" He tells me for $6 he could get me one more piece of fish and I tell him I'm not paying that for another piece this size. At this point my boyfriend is offering me his food, but that's not what I wanted. Finally I tell the manager just take it back, I'm sorry to see you toss that but you are doing nothing to satisfy this customer.

At first, I thought I was going to have to drive beyond the city but, no, happily it's not far from downtown.We got there about 5:30pm and got a little tour of the property first, and it's quaint, rustic, and very welcoming, so of course it is a place after my own heart. I could hang out in the courtyards with a cool glass of lemonade, some of their fresh baked breads, and a good book, all afternoon.There was three of us and we ordered the Farmer's Feast which is basically a cornucopia of dishes the chef creates. For each of the six courses, each of us got our own dish, so we could sample and try each others. So yeah, if you do some math, that is 18 different dishes total. The awesome thing though is that each plate is small and I did not feel like I had to be rolled out of there.Since there are way too many dishes to talk about, on my food blog you can see almost all the food we ate. http://bit.ly/dy0AFX The fennel lemon bread was absolutely divine. They bake all the breads in this huge oven outside and so I must come back when they are baking.I would have given this place 5 stars but all three of the meat dishes we got were meh. In fact, the lamb chops I got were way too on the bloody side. But hey, they got 5 out of 6 courses on the money so that's pretty awesome.Quiessence is a great place to take your sweetie for a charming evening, friends or family who are into organics and supporting local producers, and parents or the elders visiting from out of town."

So after the nice hostesses told us that we could seat ourselves at the bar, my friend and I planted ourselves at the one downstairs.  Our bartender was a friendly gal.  I asked for a drink menu which didn't have the most exciting concoctions, but I chose to order the Uptown Top Shelf margarita from her.My drink was pretty good, but what surprised me about this one was that I had expected the drink to come out of a gun.

After freshness, I decide whether I'm going back, and how often, by generosity, price and ambiance. The main reason that I'm giving Teharu ""Conveyor-Belt"" Sushi five stars is because I've been there three times now (my husband much more; he goes with coworkers) and I've always been satisfied with the freshness of the fish. The next reason for the high rating is that it's fun, and the third reason is that it's inexpensive.Note: I've always been there during the lunch rush, when there is high turnover of the food.I like that my favorite item -- squid -- is just as cheap as everything else. Yesterday they even had little baby squid legs! The items offered at any given time are luck of the draw, so grab what you like when you see it. The conveyor belt itself is funny. Queues of sushi are punctuated by random solo mutant items like pudding cups, imported soda pop and -- just once -- a can of V8. There is a badly-xeroxed and inexplicably incomplete guide to roll ingredients on each side of the bar, but you can ask the sushi chefs or waitresses for ingredients. I'm not sure why people said the service was poor; there really isn't any service to give, other than drink refills and the occasional clearing of lids, and these are done promptly. (You keep your plates in a stack so the waitresses can count them up at the end. You're charged by the plate - $1, $1.50 or $2 - depending on the plate color.) Maybe they were sitting at the regular tables.Teharu Sushi is a fun place to take an out-of-town guest or client. If you're skeptical, try it at least once!

It is as affordable as you make it on yourself and yummy. My man enjoyed a smoothie tonight and was pleased with his cost comparison points to a Jamba Juice smoothie of similar poundage, so if the man is both happy with his money and his stomach is filled life is good.  The fruit flavors pleased other people in my Mojo safari group. I tried the original chocolate, cookies and blah blah chocolate, the latte flavor, and the mint. The mint won out on my non-frozen treat honed palette (I get gelato every now and then am not a big icy treat fan) and brought a smile to my face. This isn't a revolutionary place but it is clean, well run and had good service with no smarm. Bless its inoffensive little heart."

ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323b08),"My Saturday night birthday feast extravaganza took place at the one, the only, the most fantastical place ever, Binkley's.  As soon as I recover from my food-induced coma/food hangover, I'll elaborate on all the juicy food-porn details.  Oh yeah, it was that good.  Until then, had to post a very solid five-star re-review."
ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b563246b3),"I get cheap food that's good at the time then you feel like death later.  Haji-baba has cheap food, insanely cheap food, food so cheap you would debate eating there due to the cheapness but have no choice but to give it a shot because.. ITS SO CHEAP.  The quality of the food at Haji-Baba is parallel to high end middle eastern restaurants, its FANTASTIC.  The chicken shawarma wrap I ordered was 3 dollars and change, the size of a glove box ( exaggerating but its BIG) and incredibly delicious!  I cannot recommend this place enough so good, so delicious and the price doesn't factor into the quality at all!  Go here and love it!"
ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b56324184),"Not that I can add anything more to what has already been said, but this place rocks. High caliber people running the show and working there. Always great stuff coming from the kitchen and the coffee pots. I have never had anything bad here. It is added bonus that these people are the bright spot in a City North that desperately needed something good to overshadow the lame (especially across the street). Their special events are a must. I must note that I have never been to an event there, but given that everything these peeps touch glosses over with gold,  I believe my fellow yelpers are raving about. Kudos to you Press. I love you."
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b563234fa),"Its always happy hour when you have alcoholic ice cream. Loved every flavor, Lee was the nicest owner in Scottsdale. She makes it hard to decide which delicious flavor to go with I couldn't decide. I eventually went with apple pie with spiced rum! Sooo good, And she rotates flavors. I will be back very soon. Go here!!!"
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324b91),"Morton's has a fine reputation, and for the most part it lives up to it. The Steaks are sublime, though I wasn't as keen on the asparagus or potatoes here... I am not sure their prices are always in line.The drinks are all top shelf and worth every penny."
ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b56324214),"I used to go to the little one in Tempe on Apache road by ASU a little over a decade ago to meet my chemistry tutor (hey chemistry is pretty tough for some of us, don't be hating).  It was $15 an hour then, I can't imagine what a chemistry tutor costs nowadays? Anyways, been driving past this one forever and always discounted it as, it is probably just an OK place but always blew it off.After a little Trader Joes visit we decided to check it out.  Glad we did.  The place was busy but it was Sunday at lunch time and they seated us right away and we ordered the Jalapeno Cilantro Hummus and it came like 5 minutes later.  Let me say that this is the best Jalapeno Cilantro hummus ever!  So fresh and actually spicy.  This hummus actually has loads of flavor and the consistency was perfect.The place is huge, like Miracle Mile deli or something that kind of big, not like the little place I remember in Tempe years ago.Next up was the Chicken Shawrma, it was very good.  Big and bountiful (that's what she said), and chock full of tender white meat chicken.The Mediterranean salad was to great.  I loved the mini white raisins and the dressing.  Huge tasty fresh salad.The pita bread was average but did the job.  I always thought this was a little to go place like the one long ago in Tempe (I don't even know if it is still there?), but in actuality it is a full blown sit down restaurant.  The staff were very friendly and efficient and we will definitely go back there again.  I guess in my mind I thought Pita Jungle was what Chipotle is to Mexican food, boy was I wrong.They have a reverse happy hour too that may come in handy for a late night.Definitely recommended.  No Chemistry tutor required."
ObjectID(5165b71d74c3068b56325d8d),"This is hands down the best place for bagels...but more importantly... after all my travels it has the BEST Bialy ever.I just wish they would open on in Greenville.Oh it is soooo good, a poppy seed bialy toasted with cream cheese...I guess I can only hope they are always open when I visit Scottsdale....n"
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b563251f0),"The first time I went here, I didn't come away feeling very satisfied mostly because I'm cheap at times. I spent nearly $7 on a cookie and a ""winkie."" The winkie was good but it wasn't *that* good. I was sorta sulking about that and didn't think I'd go back. But alas, on my next visit, I got one of their Dairy-Queen-like ""Tsoynamis"" and damn if that stuff isn't crack. I went back a second time in four days because I had to have some of that cream, non-dairy goodness. I had a PB-Chocolate one and more recently a 'Smores one with marshmallow fluffer. Good stuff. I like the coconut milk better in some ways. Anyway, I have to be careful around that place but I mean that in a good way."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56325141),"Sushi in Phoenix is a touchy subject. But, some friends had heard good things about Sake Bombers so we decided to drink away the week there. We were seated immediately and our server, who had a great butt, came over and asked for our drinks. We ordered some baked tofu and also edamame. Baked tofu was awesome and the miso soup was good too. As for the sushi, a friend ordered the Vegas roll and she said the jalepenos on it were kinda unnecessary. I had an avocado roll and the veggie roll sans cream cheese which were both good.Sake Bombers gets a -1 star for letting us continue to drink sake...two bottles of sake between three girls. And gets another -1 on the fact that our server, mr. cute butt, did not ask for our phone numbers. Scratch that...it wins one star back for the excellent service and very friendly staff."
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323376),"I love getting my Pirate Booty from here (the puffs people) and the ready made pizzas, pretty much everything that they have ready made is really good. The store can get pretty crowded, especially during the dinner hour rush. Employees are friendly and I recommend you take advantage of the samples throughout the store. Come hungry!"
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324f09),"I have had some good digestive experiences here. Also, I have kin who works here... so that's another incentive for you to step in."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b563255a4),"Ugh. Ugh ugh ugh. I hate reading reviews where the person just complains and complains, but...this is about to be one of those reviews.Things must have changed here in the last few years because I remember ordering from here in high school and the food was good. I went here recently with a friend. She ordered sweet and sour chicken and I ordered beef chow mein. The water didn't even taste right...it had a really weird aftertaste and I avoided it after the first sip. My friend's sweet and sour chicken is what awarded this place the 2 stars I gave it, but my chow mein was ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. I can't even say that it was beef I was served (sorry to have to make the usual Chinese restaurant reference, but truly, it did not taste or smell like beef at all). When the waitress came by and saw I had not touched 99% of my food, she asked if everything was okay and if I needed a box. I informed her that I was not happy with the way the meat was cooked, and she said, ""Hmm"" and walked away. Apparently that was a sufficient response, and I didn't hear another word from her afterwards.There are so, so, so many better places to get Chinese from in Phoenix, even in this neighborhood...just don't come here."
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323e71),"Great atmosphere, good chai, yummy boba and -excellent- desserts. The walls are completely covered with graffiti/urban art, and it's worth the price of a drink just to sit and look at all of the doodles. As an added bonus, it's in the same plaza as an Asian market, several varieties of Asian restaurants and an Oregano's.Go, drink and enjoy!"
ObjectID(5165b71d74c3068b56325e6b),"When it's time for a great dinner out and $ is not a question, we go to The Keg.  Service and food are excellent.   the only thing I would change if I could would be to make it less expensive so I could afford to go there more often.I can't decide which is better there, the food, or the attractive ladies involved in serving it.  I can tell you that they are not an 'equal opportunity employer"" and I appreciate that.  If I could change anything about the restuarant, it would need to be a quieter facility.  However, I'm there for the food, so I tend not to notice the noise."
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b5632372d),"I'm not sure what happened but this place went downhill fast!! Ordered a pizza last night with sausage, cheese and fresh basil.. the baked the fucking basil so it turned black and nasty.. the sausage tasted like it was on the verge of spoiling, very gamy!! Plus the older woman behind the counter was not pleasant at all.. where is the old man, I miss his surly service and his killer pies!"
ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b563244a9),"Great spot, but it get's wayyyy too packed! Sort of a double edged sword, if it weren't always so packed it probably wouldn't be such a hotspot, but being so packed makes me decide to not go there about 60% of the time it crosses my mind.My advice, if you are gonna go, go early and lock down a good location..."
ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b5632475d),"I had take out from here the other night because I wanted to see what was quick and close around my hood and I ordered some traditional chicken dinner plate. I got inside and was told the bartender had my order and to pay there, so I walked over and 4, yes FOUR people working there were having a conversation about one of the girls traveling or some stupid crap and didn't even look at me to help me for 5 minutes. I'm not ugly, I am actually super cute so I was freaked out by this and said ' oh hey is this where I go to pick up food because it seems like no one is helping me' and they looked over, pissed that I interrupted them. No tip for you, OK here's a penny. Anyways the food was eh nothing special the rice was weird and the steamed veggies were probably frozen earlier that evening. But if you have limited food choices and you live downtown its a viable option I guess....."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324bbb),Been here twice and that's enough for me. First time was for drinks and hummus at the bar. The hummus was flavorless and definitely over priced. The second time I sat on the patio for 15 minutes and not a single sever came over. The bartender noticed we were sitting there and did nothing. I won't be back.
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324de0),"Just wanted to let everyone know that Sylvia's is now a wait-to-be-seated, order-at-your-table restaurant.  They are still working out some kinks -- as in, training waiters to be actual waiters. But, the food is still great!"
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b563250d7),"It was my 30th birthday. I was feeling good- drove to AZ  with the top down. Got a killer suntan (which I never do), and wasn't hung over, a lovely habit of birthdays past to break. You see, I'm just too mature for all that now... not to mention wise. Yes, I officially became wise that morning. It was pretty rad.So, anyway, I went out with my mom in Scottsdale, AZ to celebrate the big 3-0. She took me to the ""hippest"" place she knows of... a.k.a. the only place she knows of Eli's, or as I like to refer to it, 'Cougar Central'. It was a cute place in all, I mean it's frickin' huge compared to any place in LA. I could've played a round of golf in there, but it started to depress me a little. I was like, thanks Mom, is this what I have to look forward to? Will I one day have leathery skin and bad makeup to go along with my blond hair and fake boobs the size of watermelons, because I'm trying as hard as I can to detract from my withered face and still be sexy? What are you trying to tell me here woman? I know you birthed me and it was a painful experience and your vagina is probably still mad at me, but this is just cruel and unusual punishment.But then, amidst the Frozen Strawberry Daiquiri fields a light appeared from heavens and the hottest Cougars I have ever seen in my entire life took seats at our table. Granted, they did have watermelon sized fake boobs, but despite that one faux pas (it is Scottsdale after all), they were 'classy' from head to toe; stylish, but not in a, ""I bought this outfit at ForeverSlutty1 this morning"" sort of way; well put together- no tacky bleached porn star hair- no bad make-up choices, just some hot to trot confident 50 year old women- and these women had some dance moves too! Thank goodness Eli's provides some live music... You'll be in heaven if all your favorite songs are from the 1994 top billboard chart... I kid, but not really. Anyhow, these Cougars sorta put me to shame on the dance floor.So, on with it, I watched as  gross middleaged out of shape men, one after another, pursued these hotties with passion in their eyes, and these bitches be like, ""NEXT."" It was rad! So, the moral is: there isn't a fucking moral, but this was my experience at Eli's and Cougars are A-OK."
ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b56324379),"So close!!!!!For the last 15 months, I've been searching the valley looking for a passable italian beef sandwich.  I think I found it at Luke's.It's not great, it's not amazing, it's not orgasmic, but it's good.  Ok, so probably somewhere in between good and very good.  The beef here is about as close to Chicago style as you're going to get; thinly sliced, properly seasoned with some nice sweet peppers.  The bread is a little different than I'm used to, most Chicago places serve their beefs on an 8'' roll that is close to a bratwurst roll.  Luke's serves theirs on about a foot long thing that resembles french bread.  The sandwich is authentically messy and drippy.  Please don't expect to eat this daintily.  It does not happen.  Roll up your sleeves and bring extra napkins.  I'll be back when I need a fix and don't mind eating an entire day's worth of calories in one sitting."
