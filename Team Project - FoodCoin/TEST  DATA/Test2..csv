Ladies, they have an osculating bidet that has front and back controls.......There was a large (and excessively rowdy) group of us in one of the private Karaoke rooms celebrating Nathan S's 35th birthday this  past Saturday and I gotta say, I had a damn blast. We sang Love Shack and Sweet Caroline and Careless Wisperer. I even did an inappropriate duet to ""Like A Virgin.""Oh, and those pear vodka champagne drink things?? I unknowingly sucked down 6 of them. Thanks to Georgie S for making sure it was Grey Goose. Anyway, sure I paid $54, but I was seriously having the best drunken blast and I felt like I hadn't touched a drop the next morning.So, the waitress fucking hated us, but we had a g-damned blast. A BLAST. We twirled on poles, sang horrifically at the top of our lungs and probably contracted some diseases from the booths and carpets, but whatevs, it was a blast!And P.S... I never actually used the bidet.... really... for more than a second"
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324f35),"I tip my hat off entirely to yelp for this find because without the yelp reviews, I would have probably never driven by this shop in the first place and if I did, I probably wouldn't have stopped. But thanks to the world of yelp, I know better! I can finally say that after months and months of reading up on the yelp reviews, I have officially tried The Meat Shop. The verdict? A+. A+ indeed! This week, we were celebrating a birthday and a birthday calls for the finest of feasts! Since we decided to make it a night in instead of a night out, I knew that it was time to check out The Meat Shop. I arrived at 3rd and Buckeye and passed it the first time by accident, but I quickly turned around and pulled into the parking lot. The only indication that it's there is a small sign and a large painted pig on the front. I walked inside to find a very humble store of only a small entry, counter and a large window that let me look straight inside to the butcher chopping his meat in front of my very eyes! It was definitely a sight and especially since Phoenix lacks many butchers in this fine city. In fact, I can't name many other shops that are only butcher shops. It's a lost art. I went to The Meat Shop knowing that their beef is top notch and their bacon is a must-try, especially after reading up on Scott W's review and seeing the pictures on yelp. Sadly, I am not that well-versed in my cuts of meat, so a butcher could have sold me a cow's right ankle saying it was filet mignon and I wouldn't have known the difference. But luckily Paul the butcher helped me out and he steered me in the right direction. Paul suggested I get the Tenderloin and a filet. The filet was for me and I asked him to keep it small (several weddings this summer so I must watch the waistline!) So he disappeared into the back to grab the meat and came out with two beautiful cuts (pictures included on the page). What caught my eye was that they were wrapped air tight and ready to be frozen if I chose to. Paul also pointed out that the cuts had barely (if any) fat on them, so they were very lean. Good for my waistline then right? All the meat is also locally raised without any added hormones, etc. So I had my meat, but I couldn't leave without some bacon. Did I need bacon? No. But could I visit The Meat Shop without buying bacon? Nope. I asked Paul which bacon was best and of course he brought me out all three styles and each style looked tasty. There was the bacon slab, sliced bacon and buckboard bacon. I ended up purchasing some with the excuse that ""of course homemade three cheese macaroni could use some bacon..."" So yes, I put bacon in the mac 'n cheese. The purchasing experience was extremely pleasant and I was appreciative to Paul for walking me through my purchase and helping me with my meatucation. He also told me that the meat would keep in the refrigerator for up to a week and then could be frozen as long as I liked.I got home and first fried up the bacon. I've never seen bacon sizzle so perfectly. Imagine what the bacon looks like in a Christmas movie when it's frying in a pan. This is what it looked like. Completely perfect. It tasted just as perfect (I had to have a bite!) It was like I was in my own Christmas movie with the beauty of this bacon. The next day, we grilled the steaks and after adding olive oil and garlic salt, the steak was ready to eat. I was told that a good steak doesn't need A-One sauce. Did this one need it? No siree! I will definitely be back to The Meat Shop, but the only downfall is that it's not exactly cheap and it's kind of a drive for me, so for that, I will leave my visits to The Meat Shop for a special occasion.Discount alert! When I was there, I also saw a sign for 50% off the meat that they had to freeze. Deal worth driving to for!"

Yes the place is dirty and a total dive but that just adds to the experience.. if it were clean I don't think it would be very good. My theory is that Vietnamese places are usually a little dirty cause it's good luck! The BBQ pork B?_nh m?é just makes my mouth so damn horny! I'm dripping just thinking about it! Be sure to try the B?_nh m?é bo kho (beef stew), its the best Ive had and none in Westminster or Santa Ana have come close."
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b563239f6),"If you are reading a review on In-N-Out...I am slightly worried that you have been living in some sort of underground shelter for way too long. Then again, you may just be looking to see what items to order to shake up your current order. So here's my favorite: grilled cheese...yes, they make grilled cheese at In-N-Out and they are oh-so-good! If you order just a grilled cheese it will come exactly like the cheeseburger minus the meat; they throw on all the same toppings. You can also order a grilled cheese-plain. This will be the toasted buns with a cheesy center of wow! I like to get one of each, one plain, and one regular minus the sauce and sub regular onions for grilled onions- so in a sense, animal style minus the sauce. :-) I also like their fries. I will get them animal style minus the sauce. You end up with a box of fries with melted cheese and grilled onions. So good! And the bottom half usually doesn't have toppings so you also get some plain fries. Wash it all down with a coke! All American Yumminess!"

Who knew you could hear amazing blues music for free -- in Sunnyslope of all places -- on the 2nd Saturday of each month!? I did, actually. The real question is why don't I go every month!?So, now I'm hopped up on a dirty chai latte and I must share the details about this neighborhood gem. Truly, the Valley's BEST neighborhood coffee shop! For a number of reasons...1.) Grinders is a place where everyone feels welcome from high school kids to retirees taking advantage of the free wi-fi.2.) They roast their OWN beans. That's right. They wheel a roaster out onto the same concrete slab that becomes the stage for Valley blues legends like Ronnie Whitehead on 2nd Saturdays and roast the beans for themselves!! I find their coffees to be pretty earthy and smooth. 3.) The fudgy pecan brownies are rich and chocolaty. The scones are biscuit-like and just the right amount of barely sweet. (I haven't tried the danish, but they look deadly!)4.) They are generous in sharing their own talents and promoting the talents of others, ensuring access to arts and culture. Each month, they allow a different local artist to show their work on the coffee shop walls. And while ordinarily they are not open past 6 p.m. on Saturday, an exception is made on the 2nd Saturday of each month when you can sit outside and listen to  live jazz and/or blues from 8 - 10 p.m.  And, by the way, Dennis, the owner, is a bad ass on the harmonica! We really are so lucky to have such a great business, doing great things, in the community!"
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323a99),"We've been here quite a few times over the years and have only had one bad experience a few years ago. In that case we talked to the manager and he not only comped our meal (there were 4 of us), he gave us a $50 gift card toward our next visit.As I said, that was our only bad experience. Four of us went there last week and once again, fabulous. I can't say enough good about this restaurant. It may be a little noisy but the staff are very friendly and attentive. The food is absolutely delicious whether it's the appetizers, entrees or desserts.Their steaks are so juicy and tender, they just melt in your mouth. No sauces are even required. I'd love to know their secret so I could grill them like that myself.I believe I'm a customer for life!"

My mama and best girlfriends treated to me a fun day for my birthday and I insisted on wrapping up the afternoon with happy hour on me. I've never been but we wanted to go somewhere nice and stopped in. The restaurant is beautiful- we sat in a high back comfy booth in the bar which is really nice. The bar has shelves of backlit colorful liquor bottles above it (ala the Ocean Club bar). We has 2 rounds, including the Vitamin C martini, White Chocolate Martini, Flirtini and Black Cherry cocktail- they were all really great! We also got the colossal shrimp appetizer (which technically weren't all that colossal, they were just normal), the sliders (the bacon and maytag bleu cheese was amazing!) and the AZ Eggrolls (a bit on the greasy side but very tasty and perfect for happy hour). The tab was only $65 (it was happy hour and the prices averaged about $6/ drink and app). The service was also extremely good. It's been a long time since I felt like raving about a restaurant- it was great!"

Amazing French toast, too: cinnamon raisin, or stuffed with whipped cream cheese & blueberry compote if you wanna be a gluttonous pig like me. Be a gluttonous pig like me! Be a gluttonous pig like me!The breakfast sandwiches are good, too - but not nearly as indulgent :(Reasonably priced too, everything on the breakfast menu is right around 6 bucks."
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b5632386c),"Holy crap, it's not a mirage...decent Bun Bo Hue w/ all the good stuff in AZ??!!They specialize more in rice plates, so I was a bit tentative, but definitely worth getting when you feenin' for that pig blood."
ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b56324226),"First off, let's get this out of the way...I'm Cambodian and I was so excited to hear Phoenix had a Cambodian restaraunt when I moved here...After a job interview one day, I decided to come here for lunch...Place is a little small, so you might drive past it a couple times before finding it.When I walked in, I was greeted by a waiter who was wearing traditional Cambodian clothes...Pretty cool...I decided to get the Khmer BBQ rice platter. It came with 2 beef skewers, 2 chicken wings, pickled carrots/radish salad, 1 eggroll and rice. It was delicious...It felt like home cooking to me.The only complaint I have is that it left me hungry still. The portions could be bigger but the prices are very cheap here so I guess it works.I'll definitely be coming back sometime soon when I miss my mom's cooking."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b563253bf),"Holy Crepe...this place is amazing!  My friend and I came in and were dazzled by the friendly staff and delighted by the gourmet crepes.  She got the papa k with ham, pepper jack and mushrooms and I got the veggie stack. The expertly prepared high quality ingredients resulted in hard core multiple crepegasms.  We wrapped up our crepe escape with the vanilla bean custard crepe served with berries. They won't give it to you to go but stop crying and just eat it there - it's totally worth the 5 minutes. I suspect the ambiance in this place is pretty cute but I was so hypnotized by what was happening in my mouth (and a hot chef) that I can't really remember much about the decor.  Even if these crepes were being served out of a dumpster I'd still be back to try everything on the menu."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56325c34),"Pane Bianco is to sandwiches what Pizza Bianco is to pizzas, namely heaven on earth. Both share Chris Bianco's dedication to using only the freshest, locally-sourced ingredients.  Pane Bianco features home-made bread baked in on-site wood ovens, hand made mozzarella, basil and greens out of Chris's own garden, and high quality meats from locally owned Schneider sausage. You can't get more local, or better quality than this. Pane Bianco has the added benefit of being a sandwich counter, which means you don't have to wait hours for a taste of deliciousness.  Although as others have mentioned at the lunch peak you may have to wait a few minutes; after all quality can't be rushed.  Take the opportunity to grab a coffee next door, or better yet, get to know your fellow sandwich fanatics--this is how community is built.  If you are looking for an infinite selection of sub-par ingredients, or care more about price than quality, there are several other sandwich shops for you. so please don't bother coming here. And if the idea of ordering along side individuals who don't look like suburban clones scare you, this likely isn't your place either.  Check out one of the approximately 1,912 other sandwich shops in strip-malls throughout the Valley that cater to your tastes.  But if the freshest,and highest quality ingredients, knowledgeable service and authentic surroundings are are important to you, Pane Bianco is your type of place.And if you do value quality over quantity, and authenticity over generica, but still feel that $8 bucks is a little steep for you in the current economic climate, share with a friend. The portions are generous enough to share and still feel satisfied. (although be sure to snap the chocolate treat for yourself!)"

It even reminds me of a place back east with the owner (owner's wife?) working the door and the old school dessert ray presented by the waiter. Marcellino is not cheap, but it's price in on par with other high end Italian like Bravo Bistro, Um Bacio, Le Cabaffe, Tamasos...etc. But Marcellino might be the best!"
ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b563246a5),"Why Cafe Zuzu's brunch deserves all five stars:The menu -  First of all, there is one, not a buffet with food made who knows when on a mass scale.  It's a pretty big brunch menu with items to satisfy kids to entry-level foodies to those annoying health couscious people.The service - They take reservations and actually honor them!  The hostess and manager were super cool about letting us load up a booth meant for 4 with our 5 selves.  Our waiter was the best - we had one of those guys in our party that insists on waiting and waiting before ordering and usually ticks off the wait staff because he'll send them away 2 or 3 times before he's ready to order - waiter showed the patience of Job and kept up the refills too.The food - Here's a breakfast for you:  layer of buttermilk pancake, dollop of banana pudding, another pancake, more pudding, one more pancake and pudding topped with bananas and real maple syrup on the side.  Over Easy should take some lessons from Cafe Zuzu's chef.  Just writing this is making my mouth water.  Everyone else loved their food too, though other than the eggs benedict and burger (both great), I don't know what all the others got because my attention was laser focused on the pancakes.  Oh - talking about the pancakes almost made me forget they gave us a basket of bread when we sat down.  I don't know if it's the same every day, but in it was some kind of scone-thing with cherries and chocolate chips that was outstanding.It's in the Valley Ho hotel, so the easiest way to park is to valet, which is free for Cafe ZuZu customers.  The valets sometimes forget and try to charge, though, so be sure to remind them."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b5632492a),"I like the Thai Hut because it is safe Thai eating. They have some of the more adventurous authentic Thai, and then they have what I ALWAYS get - The Garden Delight with beef. Just basically vegetables and beef cooked in a marinade. They always have plenty of servers on hand and I've never been disappointed. There's just some little sparkle that it seems to be missing.I struggled between giving it a 3 or a 4, but I settled on a 3 because they could definitely improve the atmosphere a little bit and parking sucks. They are really close to the light rail now though, just get off at McDowell/Central and walk one block east on McDowell."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56325a6f),"The burgers are good, the fries are okay...but the custom milkshakes are to die for.  I go for that reason alone.  Hells ya!  Cheesecake flavored milkshake, blueberries, cookie dough, etc etc etc.  Oh man, that's good stuff.I hate the decor but you can get a milkshake to go and life is right."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56325492),"I recently became a huge sushi fan with this place and Ra being my favorites. Blue Wasabi is so different from other sushi joints including Ra in that their rolls are very untraditional but very yummy. I go here quite often and always try to get something new. Here are my personal favs:Rolls:Get Clucked (or the clucker as my friends and I like to call it) - Fried chicken and avocado with a sweet chili sauce, does it get any better? Non sushi people will love this rollSurf and Turf - Fried shrimp with pineapple salsa. Soooo good. Another non sushi persons rollDam Jumper - Wrapped in salmon, no rice at all in this roll. Kinda spicy. Different but very good. You might not likie if you are not into raw fish though.Marco Rolo - Kinda has an italian flavor to it but it is a really nice combo in a roll. Another sushi haters rollRainbow rollCalifornia Roll - How could you go wrong?Side note: Although the PITA roll taste good, it is a difficult roll to pick up with chopstix without it falling apart. So if you are not good with stix, you might not wanna get this one.Martini's:Lemon Raspberry Ice - The best Martini I have had hereGrape Escape - Taste like Grape Coolaid with a kick!Key West Martini - A good dessert drink. Creamy and taste like key lime pie. I love the graham cracker crumbs around the rimOther food:Fried Pizza rolls - These are surprisingly good. A good choice for kids (even though I really dont think you should bring kids to any restaurant). Pork Pot stickersBuddha Burgers - The meat in these tastes like quality beef, almost as good as Kobe beef. Not sure what kind of meat it was. The sweet potato fries are awesome!To sum it up, this place has alot of options for everyone. If you are not a sushi lover, you can still have sushi rolls that you will probably like. A little tip: if you hate seaweed which is in most rolls, you can substitute it with rice paper. The service has always been good every time I have gone here. The price is a little high though not any higher than I have seen at other sushi places included Ra. Try this place, you will love it!"
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b5632593e),"Great, authentic middle eastern grocery and super cheap to boot. Don't miss the bakery or the little restaurant. The food is great and you can eat right there. I would recommend the flatbreads. Don't expect anything fancy- very casual atmosphere- but the nice staff and great food will keep you wanting more."
ObjectID(5165b71d74c3068b56325e68),"I don't get this place.  Had great service from Summer in the bar but the food is just OK,  $15 for a chimichanga really $15? yes $15 I still am shaking my head over that. I can go to chipolte and get a burrito twice the size with better organic ingredients for less than half that. everytime we go I ask why why but hubby is addicted to the chips and salsa,  whatever it's again OK but I've had way better elsewhere.  Still half of Phoenix thinks this is the best Mexican food around. I just don't get it."
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323bb6),"This is the nicest Whole Foods Market we have been to. The produce is fresh and the best looking organic food around. The choices are endless. The store is clean and the staff is helpful and friendly. They actually seem to enjoy their jobs and love to help. Unlike most grocery stores, it was alway easy to find someone knowledgeable to help. It is well worth the drive."
ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b56324503),"I began my love affair with Ethiopian food last year when I went to visit a friend in New York and he opened my eyes to the delights of this interesting, yet amazing food.I'm not sure if I can actually classify it a ""love affair"" being that I have only been three times now, but it is what it feels like. With my recent gluten allergy, it has been terrible finding carbs and luckily the Injera bread is 100% gluten free (it is made with teff) so I can eat to my hearts desire!Another really neat thing about Blue Nile is that they serve a small raw menu every day, and a full blown raw menu on Sunday and Monday. I don't know of anywhere else in the valley that does this, so definitely a great thing to see! I cannot wait to come back and try their raw creations. That is, if you can pull me away from the injera :-)Now, the one drawback that ALMOST turns this place from a 5 to a 4 is that they have the scariest parking lot I have ever seen. I made Dallas G. watch me walk back to the car, in broad daylight, just to ensure I was not accosted. Well, that, and I have a great ass ;-)Oooo and they have this magical tea that has such a unique flavor. I absolutely love it!Extremely affordable, very tasty, great service... WINNER!!!!!"

From the outside the place may not look like much but she's got it where it counts.Once you walk in the immediate feeling is of being under dressed.  The Inside is set up like a proper date movie restraunt complete with chandeliers and frilly table cloths. Now you can go for dinner and eat your meal with dignity OR! you can go for the lunch buffet and leave all your inhibitions and delusions of self respect on the plate, since that's all that's going to be on it.  ""Lick that shit clean!""  to quote a friend. The price is cheap but you would sell your soul and all adjacent souls once you're done with this place.  Just go.  Go now."

ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323f66),"I have a special place in my heart for My Mother's because it was where I broke my 15 year streak of vegetarianism.  And I never had any of the alleged gastrointestinal repercussions that I anticipated.The roast turkey is better than my mom ever made, not that it means much because my mom never cooked.  But it's still good.  The salad bar is pretty awesome too.  It's small, but they manage to fit almost every thing I could possibly want into a four foot long space.  And, they have real homeade bleu cheese dressing that tastes like bleu cheese throughout.  Not like the crappy version that tastes like ranch with bleu cheese lumps in it.I had the pizza once and was incredibly underwhelmed.  Maybe it's better when you get it at the restaurant and not as take-out, but I'll never try it again.  It reminded me of a frozen pizza.Today, because we're on a mission to find awesome wings, ordered some wings as our appetizer.  Our entrees came out before our appetizer.  But when we told the waiter they immediately put them in to cook to our specifications.  Then they didn't charge us for it.  Nice!  Bad service?  No, just an honest mistake that they immediately corrected.The wings however were not that good.  They were cooked crispy like we like it and the sauce had the right ingredients, but the ratio of butter:vinegar:heat was off.  Too much butter!  I felt like I was eating wings in cream sauce it was so buttery.  It coated my mouth with an oily gunk for far too long.  Maybe I wouldn't have noticed if it actually came as an appetizer.I still love My Mother's, particularly for the stuff that my mother should have made: turkey, chicken, meat loaf, turkey pot pie, etc.  But I would stay away from the wings and pizza."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324de2),"I've now tried Thai Elephant three times.  My first two experiences were solidly mediocre -- nothing was awful, but aside from one delicious dessert (black sticky rice with pumpkin custard), nothing stood out, either.  As a recent Bay Area transplant, I admit to being a bit picky, but in my 6 months in Phoenix, I've found several places that more than satisfy my rather frequent Thai cravings (Swadee in Chandler, Thai Lahna in Arcadia, Sala Thai in North Phoenix, and, in a pinch, Thai Hut in Central Phoenix).  Until now, Thai Elephant hadn't really done it for me, but since the restaurant is literally 40 feet from my office and since other Yelpers seem to have had positive experiences, I was reluctant to give up on Thai Elephant without giving it another chance.On Friday, looking forward to a relaxing night at home, I called in an order for Pad Thai with chicken, Panang Curry with beef (extra spicy), and Spicy Eggplant with tofu (spicy, which I thought would be automatic given the name, but apparently wasn't).  I got home, meted out ridiculously oversized portions of the three entrees, and sat down to enjoy my feast.Wow.  I don't know quite where to begin, but to say that I was disappointed doesn't begin to cover it.  The Pad Thai was about on par with the Taste of Thai boxed dinners you can pick up at the grocery store, only less flavorful; marginal at best, but edible.  The chicken didn't stand out as being of particularly low quality, but the noodles were some of the worst I've had at a Thai restaurant (some bites were underdone to the point of being crunchy, while others were seriously soggy).Sadly, the sub-par Pad Thai was the high point of the meal by a wide margin.  The Spicy Eggplant was a bland stir fry of soggy, overcooked vegetables and limp tofu.  The tofu appeared to have been fried as a large block and then sliced, and a few small pieces of eggplant were thrown in for good measure.  The Panang Curry with beef was even worse.  Though I ordered the dish ""spicy,"" the curry tasted like straight coconut milk with a few drops of red food coloring thrown in.  The beef was the last straw for me; it very may well have been the worst quality, most gristly meat I've had at any restaurant I've ever been to.  I tried several pieces, and all were similarly inedible.I really, really want to like Thai Elephant, but after the experience I had, I don't know if I can bring myself to give it another chance -- especially since I've found so many other good Thai restaurants in the Valley and since the second-worst Thai meal I've had since moving here was at Thai Elephant's sister restaurant, Thai Basil in Ahwatukee."
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323346),"They try to be like In-N-Out, even down to the color scheme, but the burgers taste very different.  They offer cajun fries which have some extra seasoning, and if you ask for your fries ""well done"" they don't come out as soggy.  But if you're going with someone else, then one order of fries is all you'll need.  They give everyone huge helpings of fries and I'm never able to finish a single order so I just share it.  The burgers are excellent and the one thing that sets this place a part is the option to get fresh jalapenos on your burger.  Don't forget about breakfast!  This is where In-N-Out fails.

In fact the only ones you find slightly enjoyable are the ones where little Billy is running around all hopped up on drugs and there is a dotted line left in his trail and you don't really get them either.I am sure you are wondering where I am going with this. Sugar Bowl posts Family Circus comics all around the establishment and it is fitting as they are similar, in that you really think that you are going to enjoy both but both are huge let-downs.I would really like to give this place one 1 1/2 stars but you know how it goes; I am a positive guy so I will round up. The thing is, sugar bowl is just the kind of place that a Yelper WANTS to like. It has been around for 50 years, locally owned and operated, it breaks the Scottsdale douche mold/stereotype and it is old school. It just doesn't manage to be charming and here is why.First and foremost; the service sucked. When I went in, there were as many teenage kids working as people in the place and though I received a water super promply; giving me false high-hopes; I was then forced to wave down kids walking around avoiding eye contact like we had woken up together after a too-drunk night; in order to get water refills and order a burger. Secondly the food was meh. Really meh. Yeah I know it is an icecream joint but an old ice cream shop like this should have some tasty old-school burgers. You know who has better burgers? Dairy Queen. I swear to YHWH. Even the ice cream was very, very run of the mill.Even the decor, while I enjoy the old soda shop sort of thing needs a little help. There are creepy old people houses and there are charming ones; figure out the difference really.I am going to go beyond my jurasdiction here and give some suggestions hoping someone takes them to heart. I mean I don't know much; I am just a consumer but as a jumping point...I hate to say this but Sugar bowl needs to let the theme run a bit with the Scottsdale atmosphere. Scottsdale wants to be LA and Sugar Bowl should also but they should do it better!Scottsdale needs a hip late-night diner! Think about it! Get some great food stuffs, make your own toppings stay open late and charge a little more. And for the love of god take down the comics and paint the damn place or something! It could be a swingin joint where rock-stars, porn-stars and sport-stars meet up with the after club crowd. Look at how far people go to make it to Five and Diner and they aren't truly that great. Out-do them!Sugar Bowl could do it. They really have the potential but as is I would have to be pretty desperate to hit this place up again."

It's on, like, 923875987235th street and Hayden (no offense, Kristen.).So, there's that. BUT! They are expanding to Old Town, which only puts them 4 light years away from me, as opposed to 17. Woo-hoo!I'm complainy right now because of all the boozy bowling last night with you yelpers, FYI.At any rate, try the Veggie Tempura... it's absolutely out of this world dreamy. It's very light, and they don't deep fry the whole veggie, they actually julienne everything, make it into little birds nest thingies, then fry it. They also add a clump of mashed daikon sprouts to the tempura so you can digest the oil better. Our server, Jenna, was just AWESOME and gave us some great pointers on the more uncommon effects of Sea Urchin.

ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b56324312),"I was surprised when I walked in; I had the impression from the exterior that the place was much smaller, and I expected only a counter, and perhaps a few tables. Pleasant surprise to be seated, with a waitress to attend.The menu alone made my mouth water, just envisioning all the dishes.I chose the Del Rey Torta, simply for the meat content, which is considerable, and it has egg. You can't go wrong with egg on a meat sandwich.When the sandwich arrived, I thought perhaps my meal, and my mother's, were on the same plate; it was huge! It could easily feed a small family. Or a large chef. :)One thing that was odd; potato chips with my torta. I suppose it was ignorant of me to think that a mexican food place would have tortilla chips, but that's what I've been conditioned to expect.Upon reflection, potato chips are a more fitting accompaniment to a sandwich, contents of said sandwich notwithstanding.The salsa that was served with the meal was phenomenal. Not too spicy, but a nice bite, with a slightly smoky flavor. Delicious!The sandwich was, as the menu implies, a meat paradise, with egg. I can't recall for certain, but I believe there were 5 kinds of meat, including chorizo. You can't ever go wrong with chorizo.The prices are very reasonable, even ridiculously low, given the volume of food.The torta turned out to be much more than I could finish in one sitting, but I think I may have been intimidated. I will have to challenge the menu again, at a later date.I would recommend Los Reyes to anyone seeking something non-traditional, in the Sunnyslope area. Its location on 7th street makes it equally favorably for those traveling from downtown, even on public transportation.I will definitely be returning."

The bar is the first of its kind in Phoenix -- at least in the last 40 years or so -- to be incorporated as a important portion of mixed use development, providing much needed libations and nourishment for tenants of downtown midrise condo living.  For this, i truly salute Portland's.  This bar not only sees its share of regulars -- likely upstairs tenants -- but also mid-week imbibers of wine and beer, which keeps the crowd fresh, interesting, and rotating.  They even have some decent set-ups for subtle cross-bar HD sports watching ... prevalent, but unimposing.  Their patio addresses the cleverest part of central Phoenix, essentially the gateway into downtown and the oddly designed city-roof that is the 7th to 7th pathway.

ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b563245d6),"I was browsing Yelp to find a different lunch spot, and then I saw the word Muffelatta. I literally jumped up and ran out the door, anxious to try a New Orleans (and personal) favorite.DD is a remarkably clean, friendly environment. The people there are wonderful. They have imported beer, wines, cheeses, pastries and sauces for sale in the place, but the reason I was there was for the deli counter.The counter was stocked with delicious meals spread across 10 yards. I remember seeing chicken breast, eggplant lasagna, sausage lasagna, pork tenderloin, blackened fish, stuffed portabellos (man those look good), and many more items I can't remember. Anyway, about the muffelatta...The bread and meats are fresh, and the olive loaf is homemade (from what I can tell.) The italian bread isn't covered with sesame seeds, as I'm used to, and the sandwich was more salty/savory than tart, as I'm accustomed to, however it was good. It wasn't quite authentic enough for my taste, but it was a very good sandwich. I really can't place my finger on the difference. Maybe needed more salami and less ham? Regular vinegar instead of balsamic? Anyway, if you want to try it and expect a good sandwich, you won't be disappointed.  I chose the Greek salad as my (complementary) side; garbanzos, cucumbers, Roma tomatoes, olives and feta. I really liked it. I also tasted the black eyed peas; it was okay. I think I made the better selection.I also bought a pint of chicken and andouille gumbo. That's my specialty dish, so I have high expectations. Again, if you're serving Louisiana cuisine, I expect it to be Louisiana good! The chicken and sausage are both good and plentiful. For my taste, however, the broth was a little too tomato-ey. It's okra-based (vs making a roux, which would result in a darker soup) so there is a slight difference in personal preference between the two, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. It was authentic and I enjoyed it. The soup and sandwich cost $16; I could've gotten a smaller portion but I will have two meals out of it. Two can easily split the meal and have plenty of food.  Considering the quality and freshness, it's definitely worth the price."

We got a room to ourselves, and dedicated wait staff. The staff was friendly, and attentive.I admit that I didn't try the appetizers because I could tell there would be a lot of food. I had one of their biscuits, which was fluffy and tasty with the sweetened butter they served it with. My dirty K.O. martini was tasty, too. They had a crudite plate (raw veggies) that was less than appealing... just some sticks of jicama, carrots, black olives and radishes rolling around in a bowl that looked like a horse trough. The quesadillas they put out looked really good, though, and people enjoyed them. I tried half of a grilled portabello mushroom app, and while tasty, it was grilled a bit too much and was a little tough. Flavor was good, though.For dinner, I had the half-rack of baby back ribs. They were VERY good. The mashed potatoes weren't that hot anymore, so they had gotten kind of hard on top. I understand it's hard to cook for 24 people, and have the food arrive around the same time, but it seems like they could've waited to slop your potatoes on the plate until before they were going to serve them up.

The spring rolls are likewise fresh-fried. They have a juicy inside and a wonderfully flaky outside. Mm.

I have never been to Udupai Cafe but based on its failing health inspections, I would be scared to eat there. Woodlands is a nice CLEAN eatery in a nice part of Chandler.  It's not a restaurant.  It's basically a Dosa shop. They  specialize in Dosa and offer several types. They also have excellent Indian Chinese dishes.   The food is consistently good and I have eaten there on several occassions.  This is a lunch/light dinner place.  Don't think of this place like a restaurant.  There are several types of Dosa and that's what this place specializes in.  The restaurant is also modern and not is some ghetto strip mall so don't worry about failing health codes here...at least not for a while.NegativesTheir non-South Indian dishes are not so good. For non-Indians, they should be informed that this is a Dosa house so order dosa and other south Indian dishes.  Don't order your typical Indian restaurant favorites like palak paneer (it wasn't good here).   The owner also says every dish is excellent which isn't true; he is kind of a businessman so he doesn't really care about telling you which dishes stand out.  Stick to the Dosa and the Vegetable Manchurian.  Their mango shake wasn't very good. Their chiku shake is great."

Ah, a banker's dream.This is where my coworker, Dani, and I went after eating at Sens. She was going to a blind date and didn't want to show up alone, for fear that this guy would be a total psycho who would cut her hair and eat it in front of her. But this time, I already had two incredibly strong and delicious martinis from Sens and was very glad to have taken the light rail. I ordered the oatmeat stout and was quite pleased with it.Can I just say how much I loved the decor? I totally want to move in here...or use it as inspiration for our next home.So, the blind date guy wasn't a total scode and I let after half an hour. Dani, who was apprehensive about meeting this guy--who's a doctor, and I told her if she wasn't interested toss him my way (sorry, honey)--ended up having a good time with a nice guy.We both ended the night exactly the same: Passed out with a cocktail in our hands."

Especially since I am doing so well with my ""eating healthy"" kick. Luckily Silver Mine is open late (till 4am I believe), so I was able to grab a bite that was relatively healthy: The Tombstone: Turkey Breast, Provolone, Lettuce, Tomato, Sprouts, and just a light dab of Mayo on Wheat Bread.Everything was perfect.

I was there for a family member's birthday party and it was served buffet/catered style which was fine, but I just cannot get over the attitude from the servers that this party had inconvenienced them somehow.  It's not like they had to take meal orders, merely drink orders....On the plus side, the refills were prompt so I cannot complain about the service, despite the cold emotionless automaton of waitress(s) that we had.  The appetizers were blah - cheesesticks and wings.  The wings were by far the best bet of the two.  The pizza was Chicago style deep dish and was a whole lot of dough, and 1 slice did me in.  One slice almost never does me in, so I don't think it was that good in retrospect.And this will seem a bit odd, but there was a strange beeping in the mens restroom that I could not tell where it was coming from.

The vibrant colors, decorations and bamboo really make a lovely atmosphere.We ordered Tottie's Fried Rice which is a combination of shrimp, chicken and beef as well as the Crispy Chicken with Thai Basil both very tasty. The standout of the meal was definitely the Soft Shell Crab Fresh Spring Rolls which were the most delicious rice paper rolls I have had in a long time!I tried a Japanese beer with the meal which was also very good and my husband had a Thai beer which he loved.

We planned on relaxing here with an appetizer, drinks, and a late lunch.Awful service by annoyed and tired looking workers. Everything was dirty: tables, chairs, silverware.

I was hoping to find that little gem, but unfortunately I didn't. I had a single cheeseburger, I liked everything except the rocket sauce...no matter what you call it, it's 1000 island on all these burgers (In/Out, McD's and every other burger place with special sauce is either straight up 1000 island or some variant of it), and normally I like it; however, I did not care for this particular version. It was watery.  I did like the actual burger.Again, I'm a lover of onion rings and I was super excited to see all the great reviews, until I actually tried them. I didn't care for them at all. The breading was horrible, I ate them because I was hungry...the breading did not grow on me! The selection of sodas was amazing, they have an extensive menu, the prices are extremely reasonable, the service friendly, the customers eclectic, but the overall quality of the meal was just 3 stars for me."
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323a13),"What can be said? I've been going to the restaurant for years... YEARS! But yesterday I was thoroughly disappointed. The food has taken a major turn for the worst... Gone is the freshness, gone is the cleanliness and GONE is the tastiness. Sushi: We ordered Sashimi and a couple of roles. The one thing you expect from Sushi is freshness... Takamatsu sushi had all the indicators of DAYS in the fridge.  It was beyond belief. The fish was stale and gray. The GINGER! This stuff comes from bottles was old and smelled like pine sol... Come on man. I could have brought in fresher ginger.  Now to the main course. The bulgogi... The mainstay of Korean food... horrible. HORRIBLE I SAY. This was not bulgogi. This was super thinly sliced beef, god I hope it was beef, that had been stored in fridge and they later found and decided not to let it go to waste.  Side dishes were okay, but lacked flavor and freshness. Lastly comes the cleanliness. This should be the easiest thing to achieve in a restaurant. Don't need a pricey chef, waiter or creativity... Just need a bucket, cleaning solution, a mop and some backbone. Don't go near the bathrooms or you will find your shoes stuck to the floor like a roach motel. Don't believe me, take a sticky strole passed the sushi bar. After all was said and done and paid my fine of ~$80 to be released from Takamatsu. Lets put it this way fellow foodies. If I knew the food tasted this badly they could not have paid me $80 to eat it. Takamatsi is an embarrassment to honest Korean Restaurants in the valley.  They should close or get their act together before someone is hurt badly with their food.  If you decide to go there and get disappointed, don't blame me. I tried my best to provide you a fair warning. Thus my review... Service great  Price: $80 for two adultsCleanliness:     ...............Food Bad.... VERY Bad"

The whole concept is great.  The smell is intoxicating, even in the parking lot.  It's like hamburger utopia.   You mix and match different types of mini burgers, usually two is enough if you order sides.  The exotic meat section blew me away and I just had to try the Kangaroo burger.  I believe the selection changes frequently.  I also got the turkey burger, which I really enjoyed.  The patty had spices and bell pepper mixed in and the pineapple made it extra yummy with a touch of sweetness.  I tried a bite of my dinning partner's buffalo and that was pretty tasty.  The bread on these little guys is top notch too and grilled to be slightly crispy around the edges. The mini burgers were hefty.  Honestly, they really weren't that mini, I only got through one and a half.  There were some other big hits with me.  The sweet potato fries rocked.  YOU MUST GET THEM.  Okay, so Fez still has the best, but these are my second favorite.  I also love the cucumber water, so much better than lemon.  I hate that sour crap in my water, but the cucumber is so refreshing.  The only thing I didn't care for was the Mac n' Jack.  It wasn't bad, just not my style.  Too spicy and not creamy enough for me, it wasn't worth the calories.

I've been to this Z a handful of times with large groups and I've never been disappointed.  Maybe it's because it's a central location and they've got a private lot for parking... or perhaps it's because of those chambord margaritas? or is it the chips and salsa? or the cornbread?  Whatever the reason, I'm giving this Z a 4 star review because of previous good meals and for the excellent service we had tonight.I called in the afternoon and had no problem getting a reservation.  Julie who answered the phone was really sweet (always a good sign), and Matt, our server, was extremely personable and attentive.  We had a group of 8 - including a few picky eaters.  We started with chips (which are house-made) and salsa, guacamole, and grilled shrimp & guacamole tostada bites... On top of that, the GM brought us over the beef tostadas and shrimp & pork dumplings - this was a very sweet gesture and much appreciated - we finished every last bite of both!  The dumplings were cooked to a golden brown and really tasty.  The beef tostadas were yummy also; I think these are both new menu items that are being tested - hopefully they will stay since they were both pretty impressive!After sampling all of that, I still somehow managed to eat my dinner salad with a light lime vinagrette dressing; it was good but nothing special.  (Nothing like their Achiote Chicken Chopped Salad which is my favorite menu item to order when I go to Z for lunch)... And then my 'Grilled Miso Salmon' entree - actually, not as good as I remembered, but tasty nonetheless... other entrees at our table included the halibut special, blackened tuna, porcupine shrimp, seafood enchiladas, and a couple of entree salads.  Everyone was happy and left full - and for just over $30 a head including tip... not bad!I'll be back to visit this Z again soon for sure... it's a safe bet no matter your reasons, and it's great for groups!

ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56325257),"Deconstructed, $14 fish tacos for lunch.  A two hour happy hour.  Our server calling us at midnight, telling us our bill wasn't paid.  These are problems.  Frank & Alberts is the all-purpose restaurant at the Arizona Biltmore, serving three meals a day.  Just a stone's throw from my office and located in the beautiful Arizona Biltmore resort, this should be a frequent lunch or dinner spot for me.  However, based on my two experiences there...I cannot recommend it.  I stopped in for lunch a couple of months ago.  When the fish tacos were placed in front of me, I was confused as to why the fish was served on the side, while the tortillas were were filled with cabbage, diced tomatoes and a sauce.  I asked the bartender if this was normal - his response: ""We let people make their own tacos"".  Okay, interesting, but I'm at a resort, and I paid $14 for the kitchen to make the tacos for me.  The fish was nicely cooked and made for two decent-sized taco, but I just don't understand the presentation.  Moving on...We had an eight-top for dinner this past weekend.  Our server was fairly clueless, but she tried.  She explained the 3-course tasting menu ($35), the buffet they were featuring that day, and some wine selections.  I went with the filet and herbed butter over spinach ($32, the most expensive item on the menu), which was served with a side of fries.  Perfectly cooked to medium-rare, seasoned nicely, simply sauteed spinach and crunchy fries...this was the best dish of the night.  Two others at the table ordered the rotisserie chicken ($20), which came with mashed potatoes, baby carrots and peas.  The chicken was fine if not boring (no sauce), the potatoes were over-worked and starchy (should have never left the kitchen), and the carrots were bland (no salt).  The worst part of the plate were the peas - they were either frozen or canned, with nary a trace of butter or salt.  I tried my mom's goat cheese ravioli with basil and mushrooms, which was tasty, but a bit heavy and not to my liking (probably personal, she enjoyed it).  Two desserts were ordered - the peaches and cream and lemon meringue tart ($8/each).   The Schnepf Farms peaches were delicious, but one small peach was hidden inside a plain tasting cake and topped with whipped cream, along with a vanilla sauce.  I wanted more peaches...as the name implied.  I tried the lemon meringue, which was way too sweet, too cold (straight from the frig, most likely), and the meringue was closer to a marshmallow fluff than a light meringue.  The whole thing came unraveled when the tab was paid.  I decided to pay cash for the bill instead of put it on the room, and left it on the table.  Others paid with cards, and one person received four copies of the bill for some reason.  About 11:45 that night, we got a voicemail from the server saying the bill wasn't paid.  My girlfriend talked to the server on the phone, who basically said, ""oh, then there's cash missing from the restaurant"".  She also spoke to the manager, who said the Food & Beverage director would follow-up with the issue.  Keep in mind...it's after midnight, on our one night at the resort.  As it turns out, the F&B director position has been vacant for a while...so we never got a follow-up.  So the question remains...does Frank & Alberts allow the servers into the hotel software to look up their guests phone numbers???  This is a SERIOUS problem and is inexcusable.  While the renovation of the casual restaurant is much improved and expanded patio adds to its overall charm, even where the food impresses, the service and lack of professionalism have left a bad taste in my mouth."

Unfortunately AZ being AZ in August, it is FAR from patio weather! However, I can imagine it to be a great place for a girls night or a date when the weather is more accommodating!Having never been here before I was salivating by the descriptions on the menu, and had trouble deciding.  The wine list was awesome, it had some options on it I was unfamiliar with, and had quite the amusing time trying to pronounce, but the bartender (Adrian, I believe is what he said his name was?) was quite helpful & answered all my questions.  He even was kind as to give me a couple pointers as to what wines I might like based on what I said I usually drank.The atmosphere inside was great, very quaint and chic at the same time.  Definitely a good place to gather with friends or enjoy a glass of wine to unwind at the end of the day. Very bright and airy, and they had these awesome glass garage doors that allowed for good people watching.This part of town does not have many options when it comes to fun, chill, and chic places, so I hope this place sticks around.

The owner is a great guy who goes above and beyond and can be seen talking to everyone. For my friends and I he keeps giving us new shots to try and talk beer and liquor with us. The way they make you feel like your at your local bar or a family dinner is great and is the icing on the cake to amazing food. If you haven't tried this place you are doing yourself a major disservice."
ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b563240b4),"Sauce is just my pace. It's a relaxed atmosphere where you order the food from a counter and it is brought to your table when it is ready. They offer pizza, tasty salads, panini's, and pastas. I have only tried the pizza and salads, but I have been very happy with both. They also have a huge selection of wines to choose from.The pizzas do somewhat remind me of Italian pizza, just a crisper crust. They have some very unique pizza flavors at Sauce. Last time I ate there we tried the  Rosemary potato, spinach, feta, and olive pizza. I was a bit hesitant about the potatoes, but it turned out to be really good. I have to admit Sauce was a bit over hyped, but still the food is good and I really like the relaxed atmosphere!"

My latte had a little heart in foam on the top. The service people were so friendly, but I feel like they should know more about what a big deal you are :) I had to educate them! I could put together a powerpoint if you'd like (kidding).The place was neat and tidy but had a nice warm quality to it. They had the convertible doors open so the breeze was really fitting for a late morning pastry-brunch.""A friend and I skipped the gym and went over to Luci's to celebrate my birthday and the Wicked pastries now being featured. We split a cinnamon roll and a red velvelt mini-cake (because according to Slade cupcake are out of fashion). The atmosphere was clean but cozy, the coffee was delicious and served with a smile. As far as the pastries... it's Slade. You can't go wrong.Luci, the owner, was outgoing and interested in our opinions of the place.Overall, it was a lovely experience. I hope to return soon for an actual meal or maybe to take a cooking lesson."
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b5632391f),"I don't like boba.  Every time I'm around a boba place, I tend to give it yet another shot, convinced that somehow I should like it.  I'm finally coming to terms with the fact that I just don't like it.  I'm the texture-oriented type and boba throws me off in the same way oysters and gummy bears do.  This probably makes me sound crazy.Without scheduled Yelp Office Hours, I never would have been drawn to Eba Cafe.  I'm grateful that I was, though, because I enjoyed the iced green tea with ginseng enough to go back and get a second cup, the second sans boba.I picked up a chicken wonton soup.  The portion was huge and I was unable to eat more than half.  The wontons were great, but it was fairly average The menu is small but varied and likely has something for everyone.  I'd have to check out other items to give it more than three stars.The vibe is laid back and friendly, but very much ""not my style"".  Unless someone pulls me by, I probably won't drop by on my own due to the location, but this is a nice and inviting shop that I'd highly recommend."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b563259ca),"The food was very good, but the service could use some work and organization. I'm definitely a person that's all about customer service and the hostess needs to be more personable and inviting. The older lady is more getting in the way than helping the situation. They need a restroom sign because I saw atleast five people almost walk in the kitchen.  Overall it's definitely a good start, just need to work out the kinks. I gave it four stars for the food and effort! Plus where do they get these stemless mimosa glasses!"
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56325b46),"This is my Pho restaurant of choice in AZ.I've probably tried half the menu in the 7 years I've been a patron on Saigon Pho.  Other than the regular pho choices, I'd recommend the Spicy Grilled Lemongrass Chicken, Crispy Chicken, Salt & Pepper Squid, and a host of others..If you are in the mood for soup, but not the usual pho, order the Beef Stew Noodle Soup w/ egg noodles.Saigo Pho has very good portions.  You've probably tried your luck with other pho places and have felt short changed as the quantity of noodles in your bowl.  you won't have a problem with that here.The prices are fair.The wait staff is always friendly and attentive.

Well today after completing my purchases, I left the store, and noticed this Japanese music playing over the outdoor sound system.  Sam had reminded me of a sushi restaurant a few doors down, and I decided to give it a shot (since I need a few more reviews before achieving # 100).I plopped down at the sushi bar, and scribbled a mark next to 'spicy tuna roll' and 'asparagus roll'.  I was immediately handed a salad topped with crunchy tempura batter.  Noticing some kind of potential shellfish in the salad, I inquired as to the identity of the mystery ingredient.  The sushi chef replied that it was red snapper.  Having been given the 'green light' to consume the dish, my taste buds exploded with flavor.  The dressing was creamy and spicy, a pleasant surprise.I was also brought a smaller 2nd salad (which contained imitation crab meat), a bowl of miso soup, and a small offering of cold edamame.  The sushi was just OK, but the abundance of free appetizers made this sushi order seem more like a bento box."

ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56325aca),"T. Cook's is my favorite restaurant in AZ thus far. I really enjoy the spanish colonial architecture, gardens, water fountains, patio, and charming walk-ways and courtyard. The ambiance is extremely romantic and puts me in a calming, reflective mood. I can seriously see myself getting married @ the Royal Palms. I've read some of the reviews and I've always had great service here. I remembered one of my dates had asked for a romantic corner to seat at and not only did they give us a romantic corner, but the hostess came with a basket of fresh rose petals and placed them all over our table. My date must have seriously thought he was going to get laid that night by just that gesture alone, but was mistaken, lol. Anyways, I love the lobster bisque-not too salty and just creamy enough. I've enjoyed the Asian pear salad, too which is flavorful and has great texture. But if you're looking for one appetizer to try, definitely get the sauteed shrimp & calamari in an organic yellow tomato sauce Fra Diablo. My mouth just started watering. It's not breaded calamari so it's healthier and also tastes better (5 stars).As for the main course:-Pan roasted duck breast with spiced confit pave, sage gnocchi & roasted butternut squash is 3 stars. I'm not much of a duck person, but the roasted butternut squash was to die for and the duck was tender.-Wood roasted ""Pulet Rouge"" checkan with a rosemary polenta cake, asparagus and Swiss chard is 4 stars. Any meat prepared wood roasted gives it a twist in flavor, which I appreciate. I usually ask for asparagus steamed so I'm not sure how the Swiss chard is (gotta watch my figure).-I've tried their fish (they change their menus from time to time), nibbled on my date's plates and everything has been really good.I want to try one of their pasta dishes next time when I'm not dieting. The bar area is also super sexy, sleek and mysterious. They usually have a live piano player at night. I seriously could come here weekly for just the calamari and architecture-it's like you're in another world besides the AZ desert. It's become my escape to mini paradise."

ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323a30),"Thanks to the impressive and professional people at Pita Jungle my husband and I were recently invited back to the Tatum location to give it another try. Our experience was excellent and I can't say enough about how the members of the Pita Jungle team treated us after our initial negative experience.After my first review of this location, I was immediately contacted by a member of the Pita Jungle team apologizing and asking for more detailed information. I was so impressed at this company's ability to appreciate my constructive criticism and take interest in remedying the problem. No defensive attitude or pushy behavior...just genuine interest in how to make their business better. Needless to say, the Tatum location proved my previous review completely wrong and showed me what they are truly capable of. Our service was great, the food delicious (as always!), and we were completely taken care of. The manager made sure to stop by several times and even thanked me for my feedback. Kevin, the man I emailed back and forth with several times, was very helpful, appreciative, and always quick to respond. I can't say enough about our treatment, both in and out of the restaurant. We will continue to be huge fans of Pita Jungle for a long time to come. Thanks everyone!"

I vowed to never come back until my friend Danielle told me that they have other items on the menu like salads, sandwiches, pasta, and burgers. I caved in and agreed to meet her for lunch at Kona. We shared some cheese and bacon fries. I ordered chicken pesto pasta and she ordered a club sandwich. A friend met up with us while we were having lunch and they gave him a huge slice of red velvet cake for his birthday! Friendly service and great food. What more can you ask for?

The patio was left intact and is gorgeous. I would recommend this for groups or for a romantic dinner for two. When it is cold the fire pit is awesome and it is quaint and charming. The inside is cozy and well designed, I usually opt to sit at the bar so I can watch them prepare my food and slide it in to the wood fired oven.

It was the little things (like silverware at our table and regular checkbacks from our server) that made it less than 5 stars. Also, the appearance of some scantily clad women ( on a chilly Sunday afternoon no less) with loud voices and awful facia plastic surgery  was a little odd. At any rate my group of 6 ladies met for an annual magazine club (we have no time for fictional books as many of us are in grad school) and the place was perfect.

ObjectID(5165b71d74c3068b56325f61),"Like all Fox restaurants (except the new Culinary Dropout at Scottsdale Waterfront), this resturant is just ok, but not great. Starting with the decor, the restaurant is light and airy, with huge windows and lots of patio seating, which is nice. However, the decor reminded me more of a yacht club in the Hamptons than a spot in Mexico. Another big plus is that the hostess (who was friendly and upbeat) gives you a white or black napkins, depending on what you're wearing. I know this seems like a small thing, but if you've ever been given a white napkin while wearing black pants, you'll know the anguish it causes.To the food: As I said above, the food is good not great, but like all Sam Fox restaurants, its overpriced. Its not offensively bad, but its not Arizona mexican. There is just no excuse for serving mediocre Mexican food in Arizona, and this is the reason why I would not recommend Blanco. There are tons of great places in this city to try for upscale Mexican food- Barrio Cafe, and Gallo Blanco are my favorites. The salsa was the worst offender. Serving salsa that tastes like Pace Picante canned salsa is not only unforgiveable, but sets the meal off on a bad foot.Try again Sam Fox."

As a matter of fact, if you just took the steak at face value, it might not even crack the top 5. But Durant's is not just about the steak, or even the food. Durant's is a classic in every sense of the word, the type of place that can rarely be found anywhwere in Phoenix. It's also a lively and classy night spot, something that didn't exist anywhere in downtown Phoenix for years, and as several new places have developed around Durant's overe the past few years, it has remained consistent and cool. And that's what Durnat's is really about.

Now that they've expanded they need to do some work to get their act together. Our server was nice, but way overworked.

When 15 minutes turned into almost 45 minutes we weren't very happy. After mentioning something to our server everything miraculously appeared. It was almost as if they were throwing the food at us.

There's a wide variety of very good Asian food so don't hesitate to try Tottie's, just about anyone can find something to please their palate. We will give Tottie's another try too, we just hope they can get their house in order to make for a more pleasant dining experience."

I heard and driven by this place many times but never really had a hankering to stop in and try the food. Tonight, I was not feeling well and wanted a nice, hot bowl of Pho. I decided to finally give this place a shot. I placed my order to go (#11 Pho with beef and beef balls - $6.50 total) and took a seat and waited. I did not have to wait long, I got my food fairly fast.

Everything looked so appetizing which usually isn;t the case when you're feeling sick.Anyway, back to the Pho... when I arrived home, I fixed up my hearty bowl of Pho. The portion was huge! More than I can finish. The bean sprouts, mint and lime that accompanied were nice and fresh. The broth was very flavorful and not very oily. Usually, I'd want to add a bunch of lime, hoison sauce and sriracha but tonight it was perfect with just a squirt of lime and the fresh veggies.

It was a perfect morning with temps in the 70s.I do not function well with out food/coffee early in the morning and I took this trip as an excuse to try out another restaurant.  I arrived well before opening so I wandered around and got my bearings, arriving at the door promptly at 7AM.  I was the first customer in the door, entering from Indian School, and the place was deserted so I wandered around a bit when somebody came out.  I asked if I could eat on the patio and once she figured out which patio was ready I was told to pick a seat.  This sort of sounds like poor service but it really wasn't, every body was rushing around setting stuff up and total time elapsed was like 3 minutes.  I gather Scottsdale doesn't wake up early, even as I left at almost 8 there were still very few customers. My server offered up drinks and handed me a menu and in the couple of minutes it took my orange juice to arrive I had made my choice.  Maybe too quick on my part, the menus only get reprinted a couple of times a year and there are items not listed which when I heard them recited to another table sounded enticing.  I had corned beef hash, scrambled eggs, sliced tomatos and and English muffin.  The eggs were nice and hot and not overcooked.  The corned beef hash may be the best I have had in Arizona.  My server checked up on me fairly often.The restaurant is divided up with an indoor seating area/bar, two outside seating areas divided by the entrance to the parking lot and a meeting room, which I did not see inside, but you could sort of guess where it was by subtracting what you could see from the overall size of the place.  I would pick outside almost any time.I would not hesitate to return here.  Both the food and the service were excellent."

We waited patiently, and kept getting passed up.  We were there for over 10 minutes and never got acknowledged.  Finally, one of the guys we were with said (and not in a demeaning way),"" hey.... we have been here for about 10 min.""  The bartender proceeds to yell, "" Do you think I give a F**K?

Yes, even at 30 years old. But the darnedest thing happened on the way to Vegan Forum... I was at the Biltmore the other day trying to buy the above mentioned totally beloved mama (who Georgie has never met, thank god) an iPhone 3GS, because God knows she's suffering through each day with a slow ass 3G in excruciating complacency, and what popped up and tripped me but one of those ridiculous Mojo chairs. As if by magic. And so, taking it as a sign from the nacho gods (see my review on Four Peaks), I went in to see if they had vegan yogurt. Never in 1,000,000 years would I have tried the non-dairy fruit flavor that they had before I boldly blossomed into the incredibly sensitive, sexy vegan you see before you. But I tried it. You know, to prove a point to myself and, more importantly, to my angsty heart. With pie crust crumbles or some such nonsense as the 24 karat topping. Divine. It was horrifyingly delicious. I was so annoyed at how good it was... Now I know it exists. Now I'll be tempted. Now I can't berate Georgie on Twitter or Yelp anymore, which is the biggest tragedy of them all... Now I only pulled the lever down for a second and a half because it apparently costs more per ounce than platinum, but on this day, that day, it was worth it."

ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b5632532d),"If Berkeley and Santa Monica had sex after an intense Bikram yoga session and then took a long shower, you'd have the Mandala Tea Room. And I mean that in the nicest way possible.A lot of stereotypes come into mind when you walk into this place: Crunchy vibe. Deep Forest-ish music. At least one thing from India on the wall. Words like ""vegan"" and ""elixir"" floating around. That said, being where I'm from, I'm used to all this stuff. Except here at Mandala there is no overpowering patchouli smell. Nor roaches tittering about. Success!We sat in the corner of the room, leaning back on throw pillows at a low table. Our friendly and warmly welcoming server, who was glowing with health and good cheer probably because she hasn't eaten anything deep fried in a decade, presented us with menus. I chose a Rooibos Chai (no caffeine).""I'm sorry. We're out.""I then chose another normal-ish tea with no caffeine.""I'm sorry. We're also out of that one."" So apparently Mandala has 54 teas and I'm having a good knack of picking out the 4 they don't have in stock. Which was briefly disconcerting. I'm a chai and kawa (green tea) drinker by birth and all this fruity tea business that was left to choose from wasn't all that appealing to me, but I had no choice and ended up going with one. It arrived in a French press, and then I noticed a whole bunch were also on sale on a shelf next to me for $30 (talk about clever cross-marketing and insane profit margins - maybe Mandala's not so Berkeley after all). And after a few drops of organic agave nectar, the tea tasted pretty good, I'll admit.We also got dessert, which I was initially skeptical about. I got the vegan coconut cake because that meant no worries on the drive home. Esteemed dining companion had raw berry pie, which actually felt and tasted like a gelatinous smoothie. Which sounds pretty nasty, but it was really damn good. Believe me. And so was my cake, surprisingly enough (tasty, not nasty). Now, I'm not turning vegan anytime soon, but I can certainly appreciate when vegan's done well. We then relaxed amongst the pillows and hung out for a long while, waxing about life's possibilities while drunkards walked past outside, trying to find Devil's Martini. Ah, the poor souls. Trying to find their nirvana in a pair of fake mamms and the ragas of Usher and T-Pain. But more power to them...Anyway, where was I? Oh yeah. I noticed that Mandala has free WiFi, which is a  bonus for folks who want to work in a quieter environment. However, the place closes at 9 most nights, which for the laptop WiFi crowd is basically 3 in the afternoon. That, not so great.But in the end, as a place so close to some of the most obnoxious places in Scottsdale, I'm amazed Mandala's managed to remain as it is for so long. Definitely recommended for those who like tea (except apparently the teas I want) and a chilled out atmosphere smack in the middle of old town Scottsdale. I don't see myself coming here all too often, because something about spending $5 on hot water with leaves is a little hard for me to reconcile, but Mandala is still quality product.3.75 stars (round up to 4)"

All of these items were good to excellent.  This is by far one of my favorite middle eastern food places in the world, even better than the Shwarma King in Bratislava, Slovakia...no joke!   I have taken people to Sahara who afterwards raved about the lamb tikka.  I have never cooked or eaten  lamb, but my friends tell me it is a difficult meat to prepare so that it is not tough and that the lamb here is excellent.

I like the fact that they make them in small batches. While they may run out of some flavors, you know you are buying a fresh one, each time.Try their bread pudding while you are there and take some chocolate eclairs to go. Lunch is okay, but, their breakfast is simple, fresh and tasty.

FYI, there is no table service so you have to order at the counter.  I will say that the staff was friendly, so that's the positive, though there should have been more staff working the counter because it got backed up. The sandwich tasted OK, but the presentation was unimaginative, the bread not fresh (so dry it was falling apart) and the portions smaller than similarly priced fare fare from other establishments we frequent.  Frankly, the best thing on our sandwich plate was the potato chips!The bruschetta was laughable! For 6.99 we received 3 SMALL slices of bread that were only partially covered with a visually unappetizing mix of toppings. The bread was not adequately toasted so each piece was somewhat soggy. In addition, none of the toppings were warm, even though the cheese on two pieces was melted and the third topped with what we would describe as a chunky mushroom paste (that was claimed as served hot)... which led us to believe these items are prepared in advance and not to order, hence the cool temp and soggy bread.Seriously! $6.99 for 3 small slices? Haven't the owners ever been to Postino to see what presentation, flavor and value are all about. Check the photo link in my profile and you'll find the one I posted of QCOM's sorry excuse for a bruschetta plate. And to all of you who will argue ""but the Postino Bruschetta is 13.50""! Yes, it's nearly double the price, but at Postino you receive: A) 4 LARGE pieces of bruschetta, cut into thirds for 12 slices total, each slice about the size of one QCOM bruschetta; B) Easily triple the amount of toppings on each piece: C) something flavorful that you'll actually enjoy eating; D) A beautiful presentation; E) Table service from friendly, knowledgeable staff.Don't get me wrong. I think it's great that the Rea Family has brought a fine range of olive oils and related products to Arizona and we have used their oils in our home kitchen.Unfortunately, the del Piero eatery is operated more like a tourist destination where they figure it's a ""one shot"" opportunity to get maximum return for minimum investment from customers who probably won't be returning. Our suggestion, take the tour, buy some olive oil... then go somewhere else for lunch where they have taken the care to give you superior ingredients, prepared with skill, in sufficient quantity to justify the price and with friendly efficient service to boot.Oh yeah... as for the Gelato. Don't bother. Go to Frost at San Tan if you want a real, authentic, phenomenal Gelato experienceThis comment for the owners: While we were waiting for our lunch we went over to the wine tasting area. The young lady hosting the tasting was very pleasant and outgoing, but when we heard her say the Pinot Gris was made from white Pinot Noir grapes we, and the other couple tasting at the time, realized we wouldn't get an education with our tasting. To QCOM and all other establishments doing tastings... please, please, please don't have a wine novice doing the pouring."

Sigh. David, the executive chef and co-owner of Liberty Market took care of us - what a cool guy. I just read his bio on Liberty Market's website and he's had quite a history. His collaboration with Joe (of Joe's Family Farm and Joe's BBQ) made some magic.I shared sandwiches with a friend, so I could try two. I had the Maiden Lane (turkey, brie, red cabbage slaw, cranberry, and a horseradish aioli). I really liked the combo of the cranberry with horseradish. It definitely has a kick to it. I also had half of The Farmer (roasted veggies, grilled sweet potato, and goat cheese). Loved all the veggies! Note: make sure you like goat cheese because there's a generous amount (Another friend got it sans cheese and liked it a lot). I also had the sweet potato salad on the side - delicious!We couldn't leave without trying dessert. We shared carrot cake (it was very gingery which I love) and had delicious frosting. We also ordered a chocolate/peanut butter square which was a scrumptious tower of chocolate, peanut butter, and crackers sprinkled with sea salt.

ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323b1b),"Went to this place last night with my girlfriend for the first time. First walking in, the place had a low-key, romantic mood. The staff was very friendly and we were seated promptly. We were seated in a private booth that was accompanied with a curtain and dim lighting. Our waitress was very knowledgable and we found out it was her first night working the floor. She seemed like she had been working there a very long time. Bottom line for this review:It's a date place for couples. There is a process for the four course meal which is time consuming so do not plan on a quick sit down to eat. You pay for the dining experience which is exciting and very sensual. The wine is great and the food is delicious. Book your reservation ahead of time as walk-ins cannot always be accommodated. I don't know how people can rate this place less than 5 stars. Even the price a bit steep but well worth the food, wine and experience with your loved one."

I've got to say this place has got the market cornered on mediocre. A quick visit to their official website shows a claim of ""Voted #1 Mediterranean/Middle Eastern ..."" I assure you, they did NOT get my vote.As far as the service was concerned; we were one of two tables seated about 6 - 7pm on a Wednesday, the waitress visited us 1) to take our order, 2) deliver our drinks, 3) drop off / pickup our check. Someone from the kitchen delivered our food. Our waitress didn't seem rude during the few times she did swing by, but also wasn't excited for us to be there.We started with an order of hummus, which turned out to be neither here nor there, then ordered a Gyro Plate and Kafta (Kubideh). The gyro meat seemed pre-packaged and the kafta (grilled ground beef) seemed underspiced and bland. We did; however, order a tasty chicken skewer side, which was good. Nothing about this meal was really fantastic and I definitely not worth coming back.

There were plenty of flavor to choose from. The wings were meaty with plenty of sauce. It reminded me of a better version of wing stop since it was cheaper, I believe 15 pieces of wings were around $11 and there was actual meat on it. I wish the sauces were all stronger. I was not impressed by the seasoned wings. The honey haberno had a kick to it for the first wing but then the haberno kind of died out. The garlic parmesan was okay, just the standard garlic parmesan. I wouldn't mind going to this place again if I was craving wings, I would try the other flavors though."

I had 2 area restaurants I had not tried on my list and Centurion was one of them. We bundled up and walked over. The cold weather was not conducive to patio dining, even with heaters, so we choose to eat in. They had a 9 top in the corner and an incoming reservation of 4 so we sat at the counter. I usually enjoy this anyway because I love watching the chef(s) do their thing. Of course in here it is so small it doesn't matter where you sit, you have a front row seat to the action. The chef was working sans sous chef and was hustling as were his waitress and dish washer. As we were getting settled in and reviewing the menu, which changes seasonally (as do the wines), the 9-top was receiving their appetizers, stuffed mushrooms wrapped in prosciutto served with a taragon cheddar sauce.  Mmmm.....we had been looking at the Mushroom, goat cheese and spinach strudle, but this helped us decide.  As soon as I saw lamb on the menu my decision was made for me.  My mom was torn between a few dishes but decided on the taglioilini with pulled duck.  The dishes were great!  The pesto risotto that filled the mushrooms was cooked to perfection with excellent texture.  The wood oven imparted a wonderful richness to the already rich dishes we ordered.  I would have to agree with Dante's review about the pasta dish, a thicker noodle would have really made the dish stellar as the thin pasta was overwhelmed by the sauce.  It was also quite ""oily"" and was evident when we attempted to reheat the leftovers (removed several tablespoons after reheating).  Not a ""diet"" dish that's for sure.  My lamb was tender and not over done, although I prefer it more on the medium rare side. The dijon herb crust and the chorizo in the risotto played off each other well.  The savory crispy yet fluffy herb and cheese waffles which accompanied the lamb were also a pleasant surprise.  Taking a piece of waffle and a bite of the risotto with the lamb was a wonderful rich taste treat. The chef made great wine recommendations to accompany our dishes. We were too full for desert...next time I guess....So why 4 stars and not 5?  The ventalation was poor.  We left smelling of all the food being cooked there that night and even had to go home and change our clothes and freshen up  before we went out again.

I usually just keep an eye on the chef and keep track of what he is preparing.  Sometimes, you'll see the same sushi rolling past you for the 100th time before the chef decides that no one wants it before taking it away, and that, my friends, is void of appeal.Does anyone else find it hilarious when a kid's fruit cup or a ramune (a Japanese soft drink similar to sprite) roll past you on the conveyor belt in between a california roll and an alaskan roll?  3 stars just for that!"

The Triple Vanilla Scooped Chocolate Chip Pizza Cookie, of course!I've had other things off the menu through the years... The Frisco, Pesto Pizza, Original Salad with that Raspberry Dressing... but they are just okay.My only complaint is the wait... when this place gets busy, it gets SO busy--Even for to go orders! I had an experience once where it was a 45 minute wait to eat there and a 1.5 hour wait for a to go order... WHAT?! And even when dining... the wait is pretty long... but I don't notice because I'm usually enjoying the company I'm with... so, if you bring great friends and lots of time, you will be fine!"

If you also think you can stomach massive amounts of raw fish and other such items involved with sushi, and only have $19.99 in your pocket... well then that's weird that you have exactly $19.99 in your pocket.Actually, I'm usually freaked out by All You Can Eat sushi, like it shouldn't really be a mass quantities-type food. But Mido has made me a changed man. It was better than some sushi places that are not served in mass quantities. And seriously... that tempura sauce. It's pretty... awesomely good/awesome.AND, if it's your birthday, they play you the ""Hoppy Bahsday"" song and you get party poppers! PAARRTYYY POPPERRRS!!!

The prime rib is very flavorful and exceptionally tender,.and you get a very healthy portion.  And seafood...yes seafood.

It's served with crisp, flat, tostada chips and is plenty to share! A real value!!If I'm dining alone, I generally get a couple of pupusas. Pupusas are like thick corn tortillas stuffed with cheese, beans or meat - your pick! They even offer a version stuffed with the loroco flower, which I understand is similar to a squash blossom. Myself? I'm a bean and cheese girl most of the time. And, I prefer them straight up: skip the tomato sauce and slaw topping. The chicken soup is flavorful and the portion size is significant, served with a couple of handmade tortillas.Salvadoreno recently got a beer and wine license, and, a I can't think of a better beverage to wash down a pupusa than an ice cold beer!Oh! I guess this can be my ""scoop"" - Salvadoreno is going to start offering a $7.95 lunch buffet from 11 - 3. Buffet items will vary depending on the day of the week.

If something deserves to be rewarded with six or more stars, it is the ability to get a hot dog and a soda for $1.61, after tax.The corporation itself is commendable for quite a few reasons.

This could rival my Scott Baio crush in the 70s. Or my crush on arrugula, beet and goat cheese salad in the 80s. Or even my 90s crush, yep, again, Scott Baio. We were greeted by a lovely host person who gave us the 411 on our dining options. We chose the restaurant kitchen bar which had happy hour prices on food and drink. No sooner had Rickie and I bucked up to the bar did we have our server take our drink order: two iced teas and a large flat water. Soon to follow was some delicious pillowy yet crunchy French bread with a ramekin of soft buttah!While we waited for our food it was most entertaining watching the kitchen staff prepare for what was sure to be a very busy Valentine's weekend. And since I was already with my Valentine, I was most happy. We had a delicious cheese plate with herbed chevre, Manchego, Pecorino Romano and a mild cheese I won't even try to spell. I had a crispy, creamy pizza with goat cheese, roasted garlic and oven dried tomatoes. Very good though I kept thinking of my favorite flat bread delight at St. Francis. Hmmm...Rickie had a burger he enjoyed though the top bun was very doughy and not pleasant to eat. Yam fries were tasty though a dipping sauce would have been fun. All that was only $36!Now. Is it just me but does every new restaurant try to out do the next guy with the jazziest bathroom sinks? Well, I'd have to say, Christopher's takes home the gold. A huge communal sink with a wall in front of you that shoots out water below as you rub your hands over hundreds of little rocks. Enjoyable! And now in the 2000s I have a new crush.

Nom. Nom. Nom.  Awesome to see fixes to large group service.  Have had multiple large groups on busiest times recently and the service has been FLAWLESS!"
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323830),"Perusing the menu of this upscale Mexican restaurant in the Scottsdale Quarter I was initially impressed by the variety and selection of ingredients. I was then highly amused when I read the description around the ceviche indicating it was made with fresh sashimi grade ""local fish"". We live in the desert. A big one. If they are using fresh ""local"" fish it would have to be from Tempe Town Lake or the Arizona Canal. And I dunno about you, but I ain't eating that - cooked even. I did find out later the company originates out of California and it appears they just reprinted the menus and/or got a bulk deal and didn't update it for the Scottsdale location. Detail oriented. The menu does offer lots of hearty brunch options and a wide variety of 'specialty' tacos. The waitress initially brought out some large corn chip type things, dusted with paprika and several accoutrements. I don't eat corn, but tried a couple of the items that came along with the chips (because for some reason she really talked this stuff up, like as in one of those awkward ""why is my waitress still talking"" kind of talked it up. There was nothing worth having talked my ear off about. Anyway, when she stopped talking, she walked away, without taking a drink order. When I did finally see her again, I ordered a mimosa, which showed up quite some time later. The bar was dead and the restaurant wasn't that full, so I am not really sure what could take so long about putting orange juice and bubbly wine in a glass. I can forgive a lot if someone keeps my cocktail full; this continued to be a challenge throughout lunch. When the gal came back to ask for our orders and whether we had questions, I had two. One, are the tacos all on corn, or can they be made on flour; and, which items on the menu have a little bit of a kick or heat to them. The first question was responded to with, ""No. Traditionally Mexican tacos are made on corn tortillas,"" which was put to me in the same tone of voice my mother uses when she can't believe what just came out of my mouth. BEGIN RANT: ""Traditionally"" not ALL tacos are made on corn tortillas. In Oaxaca, in Central Mexico, yes, but in Sonora or down the Baja the locals very often utilize flour tortillas. This place professes to be all about Baja style food and in all my times up and down in the region I have actually never had one Mexican, in a restaurant, in a road side stand or otherwise, tell me they couldn't make whatever I asked for on a flour tortilla. Anyway, a simple ""No, I'm sorry, we don't use flour tortillas,"" or ""No. But let me suggest..."" would have sufficed, rather than providing me with a snotty response as to why this ""authentic Mexican cantina"" located in one of the most affluent shopping centers in all of Scottsdale, without one non-white person to be seen, can't be bothered with catering to the masses. I am pretty sure 98% of my annoyance here was in the delivery. If you don't like being nice to people, you probably shouldn't be working for tips. END RANT.My next question, as to whether any items on the menu had green chiles or any heat behind them and the waitress pointed out a taco (see above) I had already indicated I wasn't interested in and then reminded me about the weak sauce on the table that had come out with the much hyped corn ships. I asked her again later if they had anything hotter (yes I am one of those people) and she mumbled something and pointed to this stuff on the table AND WALKED AWAY, again without offering another option or suggestion.I gave up on the Mexican food and ordered a crab cakes benedict off the brunch menu. The good news here is that the crab cakes were amazing, and the eggs cooked perfectly. And you know, authentic Mexican restaurants are known for their crab cakes benedict. They pair this (I guess to Mexican it up) with refried black beans, but they made absolutely no sense with the dish as a whole, and weren't very flavorful. I left them on the plate virtually untouched, along with the (very Mexican) fried bacon laid on top of them. My lunch date ordered a couple of the $7-8 individual tacos. He was happy and they had good flavor and nice elements. So that's all swell. I just don't get the price. I have no problem with expense, if the purchase is worth it. I think my breakfast was $18, but for crab cakes benedict, which is on par with what I would expect. I realize most of this review has to do with service, but overall our waitress was not only unprofessional and not helpful, but she was kind of rude. Maybe she should spend a little time working in an actual ""authentic"" Mexican cantina, where they would expect that she provide better customer service for a $1 taco than we received here for a $60 lunch."

ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b563242d6),"I had no idea this place was so fancy!  I'm glad we went for a late lunch when there were only a few people there.  When we walked in, we looked like a small ninja team.  All we needed were our turtle shells and goggles!  Had it been crowded for the regular lunch crowd, we might not have stayed.  I was thinking this restaurant would be similar to Cattleman's Steakhouse in Oklahoma City.  WRONG.That being said, the service we received was as if we were dressed in our Sunday best.  It was phenomenal.  We were presented with the lunch menu and I immediately found myself torn between the sliced prime rib with cheddar cheese and the BBQ beef sandwich.  The combo of the cheddar with the prime rib didn't sound too appealing, although our server told us he loves it so much he eats one three times a week (I wouldn't admit to something like that!).  I decided to get the BBQ sandwich to be safe.My sandwich arrived on a regular sized bun with a huge heaping of meat in it.  I didn't eat the top portion of the bun; only the bottom with the meat on top.  The taste was both tangy and sweet, with just a nice hint of spice.  My sandwich came with an order of skinny fries and a pickle.  It wasn't exactly cheap (9.00), but I didn't have any regrets about ordering it.  I'm still curious about the prime rib sandwich, so I may have to go back for that this week some time."

There was only one pot sitting at the counter and it was empty. One pot??? For a place this big they only make one pot of coffee??? A couple of minutes after we ordered our food a two people walked up and ordered theirs. Our food came out somewhat fast, but theirs did not. They didnt get their food until at least 15 min after we ate ours. A couple of others walked up to order coffee and the host/server said they were out. The guy asked if they could make more but all the server could say was ""we've been getting orders for coffee all day and we keep running out."". The guy asks if they could make more and the server just throws his arms up. The man looked pretty upset and just walked away. He couldve just took a couple mins to brew a fresh batch but didn't.

I am a registered dietitian and I am smart enough to know the your comments on my initial review are misleading to your other customers.  First off, I have a 30 minute lunch break therefore I dont have time to drive to your restaurant and sit there for 45 minutes.  But I understand many people have 1 hour lunch breaks and they may have time for your restaurant.  This is why I chose YC's because I can get in and out of there on my time schedule.Your goober sauces are more unhealthy than most sauces with the consistancy of water.  The only way sauces get that thick consistency is being made with excessive sugar and/or fat just like BBQ sauce and mayo.  Anyone who knows anything about nutrition and asian dishes should know that ""Kung Pao"" sauce is one of the most calorically dense sauces.  This goes for any asian restaurant not just YC's- along with other thick sauces like General Tso and Sweet & Sour.  I could really care less about these YC's recipes considering I always make my own as many people do.   I do not want a place that pre-makes the sauces for me.Your comparison is clearly ridiculous considering the portion size you are comparing must be dramatically different.  YC's does not specify a serving size.  Neither do you!  Genghis Grill Serving Size = 0.5 ,1, or 2.  What does this mean????? g? oz? tsp? tbs? cup?  Not exactly what I'd call legitimate.   YC's charges .50 cents for a take-out box not $1.  I was charged 9.99 for lunch on a weekday for a to-go order.  So if your lunch is supposed to cost 8.99 well then you do the math.You only solidified my decision to NEVER GO BACK with your rude response.  I have only ever rated a restaurant with 1 star twice.  I usually rate generously.  My initial review was my honest opinion.  I had nothing against Genhis Grill- it just wasn't for me.  Now that you have responded this way- I will now go to the extent to letting friends and coworkers about the situation.  I'm sure you will stay busy but I will not be visiting again."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324b39),"The husband and I went here for breakfast the other morning at about 9 am.  The patio was about 2/3 full but the inside was empty.  When you first walk in, you are greeted with menus that are extremely reminiscent of Pei Wei.  Turns out, you order the exact same way at said restaurant and you even get a number and choose your own table.  As I sat waiting for my food, I contemplated whether or not this concept worked well for breakfast.  The place started getting busy about 3 minutes after we sat down and I discovered the concept works quite well.So many things on the menu looked delicious, and I had a hard time deciding what to get.  For starters, they have pancakes with peanut butter chips!  YUM!  Any restaurant that does peanut butter chip pancakes gets bonus points from me.  The rest of the menu varies from omelets to brizzas (breakfast pizzas) to good ol pigs in a blanket.  The husband and I decided to share a few things.  We got the peanut butter chip pancakes, the pigs in a blanket, and a cinnamon roll.  The pancakes were awesome and HUGE!  After just one I was already feeling full.  The pigs in a blanket were absolutely delicious, primarily because of the yummy and kind of spicy breakfast link.  The cinnamon roll was also tasty, nice and fresh, but not too cinnamony.  Back to the concept of this place... once it had started to pick up again in terms of customers, I noticed how quickly the cashier was able to clear out the line.  I also noticed that the food was coming out at a really quick pace, and absolutely nothing sat on the line waiting to be served.  It works really well, but I am most interested in seeing how it works when the place gets absolutely slammed.Overall, this is an excellent place to try.  You will not be disappointed with your fresh and delicious breakfast that doesn't make you feel heavy and gross after you leave.  A cool place for sure."

I do not eat steak, nor will I ever eat steak, but my friend wanted to go so I agreed since there were non-steak items on the Restaurant Week menu.

Loved the huge chunks of avocado in it! For the second course, I ordered the tortelli (a version of tortellini). It was the perfect size, not too big, not too small. Enough for one person. It was delicious! It was stuffed with artichoke and cheese and was heavenly. I wish I had the recipe so I could attempt to make it at home. The dessert of Peanut Butter Cup was equally delicious. It's not what you'd expect it to be: it's smooth and creamy with a hint of chocolate, but it's damn good!

This plate looks like something I should have ordered, she loved it!16 yr old ordered southwestern chicken breast, he didn't care for it, he said the chicken tasted like I cooked it, meaning it looked great, but was dry, sometimes I just wanna smack him hahaAfter reading everyone's reviews, I was really looking forward to what I ordered, I ordered the Fundido, I understood that it was deep fried, but mine looked and tasted like it was left in the fryer for way too long, the tortilla was inedible, I scraped everything out of it and left the shell on another plate.   The beans & rice were good, and so what the filling inside the tortilla, the jalapeno-cream cheese could have had more heat for, but was very good. I don't think I will be ordering this dish again.We were having a good time talking with each other and decided that we wanted desert, so 2 of us ordered the fried ice cream and one ordered the chocolate taco.I was one of the ones who ordered the fried ice cream and I chose caramel for topping instead of chocolate, and I asked if it could be drowned in caramel and it was ,,omg it was soo delish!!!!! I do want to come back to Valle Luna to give them another try, the kids did enjoy themselves and the food, so they are willing to go back with me."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b5632514d),"Crust is kinda hidden and I didn't really know what to expect when going in... I was surprised to see so many reviews on file here. It's tucked away behind a grocery store. I've eaten at the sushi place next door before, but I think that was before Crust moved in. Anyway, I was in here today to speak with one of the owners and left with a giant pizza. It looked too delicious to not take one home. You can see the giant open mouth oven with a giant flame toasting up the goodness as you walk in. They were making some interesting odd-shaped pies and their toppings looked high quality. Of course, they hand-toss.The decor was really nice and I definitely want to come back to have a sit-down dinner. They have a Gelato bar in the corner as well and it took every ounce of strength for me not to order up some of that too... gotta watch my weight, right? The staff was all really nice and the part-owner was really cool.When I got home with my pizza, it was still really hot and gooey... gotta love how well pizza travels in Arizona. Giant flavorful pepperonis and huge chunks of fresh juicy pineapple covered the pie and the sauce was very unique - they apparently bottle it up for sale. It's a little on the spendy side, but you definitely get what you pay for. I'm a fan now and this only goes to further solidify my belief that Arizona is one of the best places in the country to find awesome pizza."

ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b563238b8),"Old Town Tortilla Factory's patio and outdoor ambiance is beautifully romantic. On a perfect Arizona evening in the spring or fall, it's an excellent spot to enjoy the comfortable climate. One star awarded. But if you do anything besides sit on the patio, you will be disappointed. Four stars deducted.   Our server took our order after we had been seated for about 10-15 minutes. Then it was like she completely forgot that she had to actually bring us our margaritas and food. Total space cadet. We asked for things, like waters, that never came. Call me crazy, as most people do, but I was also highly irritated by the fact that the chips and salsa here are not complimentary. That's something I expect from a Mexican dining destination. For the top shelf pricing, they could at least throw in a measly chip and salsa bowl on the house. Yeah, their tortillas with cubes of butter are supposed to replace the chips and salsa...... but tortillas and butter? Methinks not. Methinks that I'd much rather have chips and salsa!The food is mild to bland, yet it costs a pretty peso. I ordered the ""El Tesoro Del Mar"" - a salad (consisting of mostly iceberg lettuce ick), spicy honey chipotle dressing (waaaaay too sugary with too little spice), pico de gallo, corn, black beans, tortilla strips and large gulf shrimp (only 4 shrimp!! and they were hardly large, more like small to medium sized!!). This disappointment of a dish cost about $15. Overrated. I can honestly say I've had a much tastier shrimp salad at Baja Fresh, for half the price and double the shrimp nonetheless. I tired some of the enchiladas that Matt ordered, and they tasted forgettable at best. I've had better enchilada sauce from a store bought can. And then my mother, who was in town visiting for the weekend, ordered the grilled salmon. She was so unimpressed by the meal that she didn't even finish it... and she always finishes her food. It takes a lot of skill to mess up something like a grilled salmon. As far as their margaritas go, they are good but with the $8.50 to $11 price tag I'm just not convinced that they are worth it. I've had better margaritas at places with better menus. I can honestly say that after eating here once, I have ZERO desire to ever go back."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324fd5),"My old man always said if you wanted to get rich you'd buy a Texan for what he was worth and sell him for what he thought he was worth. That about summarizes my feelings about TexAZ Grill. This is the most overrated place I've been to in a while. I'd never been to TexAZ before today because I always seem to crave chicken fried steak for breakfast, and the place doesn't open until 11:00 a.m. Well, today I was craving chicken fried steak for lunch, so I thought I'd try out TexAZ out. The size of the chicken fried steak is enormous, there's no denying that; but that's where the goodness ends. Sometimes quantity has a quality all its own, but not here. Let's face it: chicken fried steak is a vehicle for gravy. Even though the TexAZ steak was big enough to feed four hungry lumberjacks, they really skimped on the gravy. Even worse, both the gravy and the steak were bland, without a hint of identifiable spice. I kept eying the numerous condiments on the table while wondering if maybe adding them to the meal would make it easier to eat. The sides that accompanied the meal let me down too. The biscuit is more like a roll, and didn't flake as a biscuit should; the corn seemed like it might have come right out of a can; and I don't remember much about my mashed potatoes. In summary: ""Meh. I've experienced better."" In fact, I enjoy the chicken fried steak at the JB's on 19th Ave. and Missouri more than the one here. I won't be returning."

I had veggie enchiladas and everything on my plate was delightful. I've also had the caesar salad, which was crisp and zingy and perfect. I'm happy with the service. Ricky is my favorite. I also adore the sweet young man who works the bar. We had a weird experience the other night though, when an employee kept hitting on my date (HELLO! GAY RESTUARANT! SHE'S A DYKE, BACK OFF!

My partner and I were thrilled to see a Mediterranean Buffet open in Central Phoenix... a food type that has been sadly overlooked in this part of town.  We saw the sign and went in hoping for the best.We were the only customers, though another couple did come in, look at the buffet, and leave.  The food was mediocre, but I do have to say the potatoes and the tabouleh were both very good.  Most of the other food looked like leftovers from lunch or the day before.  Owners - if you are reading this, you still have some great potential with this place.  Here is what you have to do if you want my business again:1- Get rid of the Asian Decor and invest in actually making the place LOOK like the Mediterranean place you want to be.  For a few thousand dollars, you could make this place look really cool2- Don't worry about filling up all four of the buffets.  Why not close down two of them and focus on putting out half the food - but make it REALLY good!  That would cut down on your food waste and get people excited about your food3- Sorry, but Naan, curries, and other Indian delights are not Mediterranean.  Just leave them off.  Did I see burritos on the buffet as well?  Really now!4 - I want to like this place, consider closing for a week and redecorate, redesign the menu on the buffet, and try again.  Unfortunately, like it is right now I don't think  you will see us back any time soon."

I figured with a name like that it's gotta be good right? I was wrong. Maybe they have the Swine flu.My boyfriend and I went to Bacon last Sunday for breakfast. I ordered the scrambled eggs with (what else) bacon, potatoes and an english muffin. Boyfriend had french toast.It took FOREVER to get our food. At least 2 tables who sat down after us got their food before we did. When we finally did get our food, mine was cold. The eggs were pretty good but the potatoes were cold and blah and the bacon was thin and just okay. If you're gonna call your place Bacon you should have the best bacon ever! Not the case. Matt's Big Breakfast has much better bacon.At the end of our meal one of the employees came over and apologized for our long wait time and presented us with coupons and invited us to come back. I was pleasantly surprised until I looked at the coupons and realized they expired at the end of April, which at the time was 4 days away! Gee, thanks Bacon!I won't be going back."

They take their food seriously and have great pride in the dishes they've produced.The locale is nicely decorated with nothing over the top.  Clean & casual was the atmosphere.  Great place for a downtown lunch.  The menu was full of Thai favorites plus a few more intriguing selections.  Enough variety that I will be coming back again during dinner.  I decided on the Moo Dang and never regretted a moment of it.  The pink BBQ pork was full of flavor and the rice was perfectly sticky.  The soup and eggrolls that came with the lunch specials were a great touch.  The eggrolls themselves were a real treat, light and crispy just the way I love them.Being only open a week, I know it's normal for the chefs to be peering out of the kitchen, watching and waiting for reactions.  As for our table, there was nothing but positive feedback.   Before leaving, one of the owners stopped by our table and thanked us for stopping in.  He filled us in on how passionate their wives all were and just how serious they are about recreating authentic dishes.  I assured them, I will be back."

I went with a group of 12 women, since we were staying at the Westin for our annual twin mom's weekend away from family.  We had a fantastic server, Alisa.  She was so attentive and kept everyone happy.  All of us were super impressed with her.  I had as usual my coconut shrimp.  I had a taste of one of my friends tortilla soup.  It was very tasty.  Our drinks were so good.  I had the Pineapple Jalape?_o Mojito and the Raspberry Mojito.  Both were sensational, I think I liked the pineapple jalape?_o a little better.  Not as sweet, but equally strong.  For dessert this time I wanted to try their newest one, the Pineapple Creme Br?Àl??e, I was happy to share it with several friends, since all of their desserts are super rich and delicious but full of calories.

ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323f0e),"Alright, I'll edit my review from before from 1 star to 3. I have been here twice since my previous review below & they have been quite slow at night & actually very friendly. It seems they have lost a lot of their bar crowd business, but at least they are turning things around in terms of service and the pizza is a good late night option. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If this is the best of Italy, I don't want to know what the worst is.Hands down, by far, the single worst customer service experience I've ever had. The owners are rude, miserable old people who apparently hate their customers.They are definitely not fans of the late night crowd, yet continue to stay open until 2 or 3 in the morning to catch the bar goers. They never sell their more expensive specialty pizzas at night (I like chicken pesto), nor will they make them by request. The woman, who clearly hates her life, begrudgingly took my order. I asked if any more pepperoni was coming out and all she did was shrug and point to the pans that were out, which I assumed meant 'you choose from what we have,' so I did. When paying I almost laughed at the fact they had a line to tip on - they must be joking. After awhile I started noticing customers walking away with their slices who had ordered after us, so I went back to the counter to check on our order. When I did, not only did I see a fresh pepperoni pizza coming out (how hard would have been for her to tell me one would be out in a couple minutes?), BUT I saw the slices I had ordered being put back out on the pan for someone else to grab. When I stopped them and questioned why my pizza is now sitting back out so they could sell it twice, she very snottily said ""well I've been calling you for half an hour."" First of all, what were you calling because you neither got my name nor gave me a number. Secondly, there was no possible way, considering we hadn't even been there for half an hour. So I thanked her for her wonderful service and walked away. A little while later we noticed a friend sitting waiting for his pizza and he told us as he was walking in, the guy who worked there was literally fighting the door with him. I guess he gave up on trying to lock our friend out and let him in - open sign still lit & door unlocked mind you. I don't know why these people hate making money so much, but if you don't want to serve people so late, then don't. It's that simple.The subpar, overpriced pizza is not worth the crap service - Do Not Go Here!"

What happened to this place?When I came here a few years ago before my wife and I were married, I thought this place tasted great--similar to Fresh Choice in California.  When my wife and I landed in the Phoenix area last July, we came here for dinner and I was struck by more of a sense of mediocrity than before.  After coming here a week ago, we found that it has gotten worse.  We all really had a hard time finding something here we liked.  The salad was mediocre, the panini was a doughball, and the mac and cheese might as well have been syrup of ipecac as far I'm concerned.Only the senate bean soup was good out of all of the things I tried.  The woman clearing the tables was nice, and we at least left her a tip.This used to be my daughter's favorite restaurant.  Now, she doesn't even want to come here again.  That says a lot to me."

ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b56323fb1),"I went there last night with bf to celebrate our anniversary. After pre-yelp, we knew what to expect as to prices, so it wasn't so much of a shocker.To the food, we concur with almost everyone here. It was impeccable! We ordered the ice tower for 2 and thought that it was very well presented. Ours came with 3 appetizers (raw oysters, crab claws and dungeness crab) so it wasn't too high. They are all fresh. Growing up I used to go to the beach quite often just to have fresh crabs, so I know what those taste like. And for 6 years living in the desert, Mastro's is the first and only one in AZ to deliver that.  For main course, I got Ivory Salmon ""Oreganata"", bf got Swordfish blackened. I am quite picky when it comes to fish, and bf isn't exactly a fish person, but both of our dishes ""surpassed expectation."" I couldn't say much about swordfish except it was fresh. We had the same dish 2 weeks before at somewhere else, it was nowhere near as sweet and fresh as the one at Mastro's. It was my first having Ivory Salmon, it was sweeter, and white (hence the name) than normal salmon we get around here. Mine was good size portion, firm to the touch, but melted in the mouth. The flavor was subtle enough to enjoy by itself, or you can add one of the sauces provided. One of my favorite sauces of the night I think was made of minced tomatoes and olives, came with the main course.Sides were Lobster Mash and Snap peas. I didn't really care for snap peas as I can make them at home. But lobster mash is a MUST for those who go there. I'm not sure how they prepared it, but it felt like mash potatoes made with lobster bisque (instead of water and milk) and added lobster chunks. It was much more flavorful and creamy than a normal mash potatoes. It was big enough to share and take home. One thing though, it hardened up after sitting out for awhile, so I'm not sure if microwave could make it all fluffy again after 1 night in the fridge.Drinks there are amazing, from the presentation, to the taste, and definitely the amount of alcohol in each drink. We decided to go with cocktail drinks rather than wines because of other yelpers' reviews. Total worth it!!!The service was amazing. We had Robert. We pretty much asked him for recommendations for everything, yet he was nice about it and very knowledgeable. Next time we go back, I would definitely ask for him again.We didn't order dessert since they gave us a dark-chocolate ""Happy Anniversary"" cake with the letters written, also, in chocolate. The overall experience was 4 3/4, just because it was a bit difficult talking to each other. The acoustic of the room wasn't very good and it got loud. Didn't see much of cougar/manther scene as we were in the dining room. And maybe it was during weekdays, we saw lots of ""expense account"" people though"

We were seated relatively fast and our orders were taken in short order, but after that service came to a grinding halt. The menu is limited in general but the sandwiches looked great, of course that was not what I ordered. I went for the $5 gypsy stew which was really tasty, but I was served a portion that should have cost $1.25. I mean seriously, soup is the classic poor people food, this had like 16 garbanzos, a few random veggies floating around in it and a little bit of potato. For $5 I could have made at least a gallon of soup. Please at least serve a portion that isn't blatant about ripping me off. Thank you. Because I'd gone light on dinner I ordered the olive oil cake thing I'd seen at the register with a tag on it that said $2.50 a slice. The cake came out with a side of 4 cantaloupe cubes and 1 strawberry in some glaze. The cake was nice, pretty much the consistency of corn bread and no heavy olive flavor. I'd never had it before so weee, new things in my mouth.  When it came time to pay my $2.50 slice of cake morphed into a $5.50 dessert. Say what? I am infinitely annoyed by price gouging and none of this food is spectacularly intricate or worth the wait. When I tell you that we waited 30 minutes for 4 sandwiches and 1 cup of soup I am not speaking in hyperbole. We didn't leave sapna until 10PM because the server forgot to serve me the cake slice i'd ordered at the same time as the soup.  Yeah I guess I'm a little bitter about it."

Just because I wasn't wowed by this establishment (i like chik-fil-a better), I probably won't be returning but if it's the only thing around I wouldn't discourage it."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b5632593a),"My dining partner and I ended up here for lunch because our original destination was closed. After ordering, we dove into the unlimited free peanuts.. so far so good. However, once we got into the burger and fries, our experience began to go downhill. Maybe it's unfair, but I compare every burger I eat to In-N-Out. This cheeseburger just didn't measure up. It wasn't bad, but not great either. We also shared an order of the Cajun fries, which weren't anything special. The worst was right after we finished eating. My dining partner and I both had the feeling you get when you eat junk food that didn't even satisfy you, but instead leaves you feeling crappy.  Another thing- I spent $5 for a cup of water and a small cheeseburger. I could get a cheeseburger, fries and a small drink at In-N-Out for the same price. Needless to say, I will not be returning to Five Guys."
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323bbf),"Well I don't feel I can give 100% fair review just because I was immediately annoyed that what I ordered they were out of.  I wanted to order the mushroom parm panini. I know it happens but it was peak lunch time so it seems to me they were under prepared.  I was stuck ordering the grilled cheese as they only had a small amount of vegetarian options and I didn't want salad.Everyone at my table had their order except me, I didn't understand why grilled cheese took so long to make.  By the time I got my order nearly everyone was finished eating that I was with. The Grilled cheese itself was tasty but I kind of felt like I ordered from the kids menu as it wasn't that filling.  The portions of the ""Side"" were laughably small.  I also think a pickle should have been included with grilled cheese. My sister rather enjoyed her Thanksgiving sandwich and it did look like it would be good if you are a non-vegetarian.  My mom had the turkey club which also looked like a nicely stuffed sandwich.I left feeling rather disappointed and still slightly hungry but I guess it's better than being overly full, at least the grilled cheese was cheap.Space is also lacking in this restaurant and it's quite cramped.  Our table was right under this ridiculous air vent that blew like a monsoon over one of the seats, my poor mom was stuck sitting there.  I would give this place a second chance but it wouldn't be my first choice."
ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b56323ff0),"Three words: bacon infused meatloaf. I could end my review right now and that would be all you'd need to know to make your decision. I am shocked this place has a 3.5 star average because my experience here was nothing short of 5 stars. The atmosphere here is casual but classy and it's the perfect location for a date night or a night out with family or friends. The open kitchen allows the guest to see the chef create the masterpiece and the staff is extremely friendly every step of the way. But the food is really what makes this place a 5 star in my book. I don't often eat meatloaf, but when I do, I want it to be sublime. This was more then sublime, it was heaven with every bite! I don't know how they infused bacon into the meatloaf, but there was a delicious taste of bacon with every single bite. I also liked the fact that I could order a half order and trust me, the half order is still extremely large! The burger here is also spectacular, as well as the Mo' Rockin Shrimp with chili-beer dipping sauce, dough balls. This restaurant is a hidden gem and one I wish I made my way to more often. PS - for all you locals out there, the vibe of Cookin' Jacks still lingers and in a good way. It brings back memories!"
ObjectID(5165b71d74c3068b56325da8),"I find it only appropriate I make Sabor Cubano my first review.   First of all, I am 1/2 cuban and was raised primarily in a cuban environment.When I first happened upon this place my eyes lit up in excitment.  ""A Cuban Buffet joint!! no way!!!""  .. Yes way... but, to be honest, I entered expecting a halfed effort at cuban food.   I mean, how good can it be?  There are no cubans in Phoenix.. and the only well known attempt at Cuban cuisine is ""Havana Cafe"" (i'll keep my mouth shut on this one and review them MUCH later).On with the review.. I LOVE this place.  Do you remember the scene in ""Ratattoulli"" where Anton Ego has his first bite of the dish Ratatouille and was overwhelmed with euophoric adolecent emotion? Well.. that was me. This is the closest to Grandmas food I have EVER had.  If you;ve never been to a 1st generation Cubans home and eaten thier food.. then you might as well hop on over to Sabor Cubano because THIS is what cuban food tastes like.  This is 100%Cuban ""comfort"" food all the way.. and done right.  I took my brother there a couple of weeks ago.  We decided to give it an 8.  My  Grandmas food is an 10, Moms is a 9.. this place an 8.The servers, possibly daughter/relatives  of the owners are all  Cuban and friendly.  The food is all there.. there is no staple in Cuban food  missing.   All of the carb and protien overload you can hope fore. The plantano fritos and platanos maduros have to be ordered off the menu and will set you back about another  5 bucks total, but have them.  Any traditional cuban meal is eaten with a side of sweet of fried plantains.  Try the ""Materva"" while you're there.  A Cuban soft Drink made of ""Mate root"" and of course// finish your meal off with a ""cafecito cubano"" (cuban coffee), she'll confirm your order as an ""Espresso"" so that you are aware its a small strong shot.I applaud this place for thier genuitiy and effort. You'll find I am not usually as positive in a review and I'll throw constructive criticsm in more often than not.  I just wish they had ""Iron Beer"".. another poplular cuban soft drink.. and maybe knock off 2 bucks from the buffet cost., but now I'm just being cheap ...hey no ones perfect."

I as well would rather eat at the near by Cafe Istanbul."
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323b40),"I love this place!  I have been going here for years.  There is a reason why this is the only restaurant that survived in the Pavilions after all of the other restaurants, movie theater, and Best Buy were closed.  You make your own mix of meat, noodles, rice, veggies, sauce, etc. and they cook it on the wok for you.  Prices have gone up since I first started going here.  I believe dinner used to be $7.50 and now it is around $10.25 (for dinner, lunch is cheaper), but it is a lot of food.  Get a to go box for $.75, which comes out to $11.  Keep in mind this includes a drink and a huge amount of food, if you get a to go box it is enough for another meal."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b563257fa),"I am retiring and was asked where I would like to go to eat for my retirement dinner.  I thought French. Looked on Yelp and found Coup Des Tartes. Reviews were good so that was my choice. Seven people went. My boss his boss who was paying, my wife and three friends. We got two appetizers. Chevre/Tomate and Interesting Cheese. Both were excellent choices. I got the Mozzarella and Tomato Salad. It was OK but I would get something else next time. My wife got the Taleggio Salad and said it was very good. I was torn between getting the Ahi Tuna and the Lamb Shank. I asked the server and she said the Lamb Shank is one of the specialties. So I went with the lamb. Great choice. My wife has to be on a no meat diet so she had the Coup Veggie Pasta. She commented that it was excellent. Then came desert. By now I have had way more to eat than anyone should but I wanted to end this night with a desert. I had the Four Berry Tart. Great choice. I am sorry I did not get the waitresses name. She was very attentive and helpful. Dinner lasted from 6:30 to 9:30. Many stories about work and my 39 years with the company. On leaving I had several people in the group come up and say what a good choice I had made. Everyone really did enjoy their meal.

My mom had breakfast there with a friend at the downtown location and loved it. So when we were on a shopping excursion to scottsdale this was the natural place to go for breakster. We entered the CRAZY busy resturant that was all hustle and bustle... I was excited. We sat down and pour ourselves some water and ordered our food. We laughed at the silly egg-centric western themed paintings and waited for our food. When it arrived it was a bit of a let down. The eggs benedict were mushy. I wish the english muffin was toasted more and the hollandaise was luke warm at best and became cold before I was done with my meal. It didn't help that the skillet they served it in was ice cold! I would have preferred it on a warm plate. The country potatos aren't anything great - but they aren't anything terrible eaither.  My mom loved her sun devils egg scramble with bell pepers and onions. Everything really reminded me of Denny's and Ihop. Nothing was substantial, other than the rudeness of my fellow diners. One woman sat and picked at her teeth with her bare hands! Mouth WIDE open and everything!! Another man came in without shoes!! not even flip flops! WTF?! I thought this was Scottsdale?! The hell?!To my fellow yelpers: it's nothing great, save your money and your time and try somewhere else."
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323367),"I dig this place, I really do, but the portions are small. They do make up for it  by packing a straight kick to your man or woman pleaser with zesty flavors. I didn't dig the guacamole-too much salt, but loved, loved, loved the chips that came with it. The place is quite spacious and modern with featured art on the walls. I went for dinner so the lighting was minimal giving the place a sexy, urban feel to it. The kind of lighting that makes you wonder if the people are really this good looking? Or is the lighting really just this good??? The carne asada beef tacos were divine. Really moist and succulent with just enough spice to make your taste buds tingle. Two is hardly enough, so we also tried the fish tacos and well, I could smell the fishiness from across the table which makes me a little uncomfortable. I did try it, though and it was okay. Not too fond of anything that tastes or smells too fishy. Reminds me of unsanitized, dirty, dirty girls. (Haha, had to throw in a visual for you all!)My favorite plate was the ensalada cortada. I loved all the ingredients mixed in together, especially the corn nuts. Genius idea! For drinks, I had the la sangria. Fruity, refreshing, and light tasting. It was really good, but I passed it on to my date in hopes of taking advantage of him later on. Almost worked, but when we got to the normally secluded rooftop @ the Clarendon hotel, they were hosting a social gathering of some sort with lots of people. Damn. Should've drank my sangria. Oh well...another day since I will most definitely be back for some more Gallo Blanco. I can't wait to try their breakfast menu!"
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b563253ae),"The food was meh at best, the service was deplorable. I ordered the chicken fried steak breakfast. First the biscuits came out when they served my fianc?? his dinner. Then came the steak and part of the eggs. The remain egg and hash browns came out. By the time I was served my fianc?? was nearly finished.  Our waitress left us sitting there long after we had finished eating. When I asked for a to go box, she took my plate and didn't return for quite a while. When she came back she asked if I wanted a box for my biscuits. I asked where the rest of my meal was and could see immediately on her face she had thrown it away. She then said ""I thought you only wanted a box for the biscuits."" which made no sense. She then left hurriedly and said she would adjust the bill but I would have gladly paid the extra $6 to leave. Both she and the manager said that they hadn't scheduled a cook and 2 waiters. The waitress said she was triple booked at her station.  I don't see this as the waitresses issue, but it seemed more like a lot of bad management decisions. What kind of manager has an all you can eat fish fry on a Friday night, and doesn't have all of his staff working? This was our fist and last visit to BBD."

But we recently decided to give them another go since most other Asian restaurants in Surprise are chains and, for the most part, nasty (I have to exempt Fresh Wasabi and SK as they are both great). Our minds have been changed, BB is really good food!We have been a few times and everything has been very good! Favorites are the chow fun, house fried rice, happy family, and garlic chicken... For a very healthy twist, try the snow white chicken and skip the rice. Best egg rolls anywhere!"

I have never ordered anything I didn't love (with the exception of the cheesecake, which isn't made in-house - it was just okay). I crave their tuna salad on a regular basis - it's good both in the tuna salad salad and in the tuna salad sandwich.  The grilled cheese is the bomb, and so is the cashew butter banana sandwich. The mac and cheese is superb, as well. Seriously, everything rocks. I highly recommend ordering the mixed greens as your side if you get a sandwich - the dressing is light and citrusy and smacks of homemade excellence. Oh, and it won't empty your wallet, either. The prices are excellent for the quality of food you get!"
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324e40),"The flavors were diverse and satisfying, the quantity generous, the service friendly and personable from our server to owner-chef Esther who came out to greet us, and the price before drinks a very reasonable approximate $10 for a very satisfying meal.    I had the goat curry and it was very good - meat & vegetables alike. There was a  - the word diversity keeps coming back to me here - diverse set of distinct flavors in the dish that remained distinct and yet made for a very pleasing combination.  I asked for ""mild"" and they obligingly put the habanero based liquid fire on the side, for which I was most grateful:  too hot for me, thought I think Norm could have sipped it with a straw!  The dining room is simple and clean with a few African art objects for good measure that don't overwhelm a pleasantly simple uncrowded cafe setting.  The men's room was clean, if just a tad less than pristine at the very end of the evening. Additional compliments for the cordial welcome despite our straggling in but minutes before the  scheduled closing time of 9PM (Sat. night), and for a really good  and LARGE lime daiquiri.

ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b563255e3),"Visited Cartel a handful of times now for lunch during the week, they're one of the coolest coffee stops in Phoenix. Since they have such limited hours, getting there usually needs to be a planned thing. They've got a solid food menu, try pretty much anything on the menu and you won't be dissapointed. I usualy grab their turkey sandwich and sometimes a pastry of some sort.Whats up with not being open for breakfast on the weekends? I ended up at Lux on Roosevelt and 3rd ave last weekend after a couple miles bike ride into downtown only to find Cartel was closed. I guess I should have popped open yelp first to find their business hours. :( Unfortunately for all you weekenders or bar hoppers, you'll have to get your fix at another stop.

They have the same tremendous selection of fresh fruits, vegetables, gourmet cheeses, oils, sauces, chips, dips, fancy teas and prepared foods.I was glad to discover that they carry  Lesley Stowe's rain-coast crisps because Whole Foods was the only one I knew that carried them. I love their cranberry and hazelnut crisp crackers. I started buying my stuff at AJs to take on my flights because it's the most convenient one to the light rail. Their salad and soup station is decent, but I wish they would add kale greens and liquid amino in their salad bar like Whole Foods."

The menu is filled with tons of pastas and all the regular Italian fare you'd expect to find, but they also have some great, unexpected desserts.They have this apple calzone that is so freaking good, but the only downside is that it takes forever to cook.  Order it while you're still eating your dinner so you won't be sitting there for another 30 minutes waiting on it. They also have a huge half baked cookie dessert kinda like the amazing one at Oregano's. And while it's not as good, it comes pretty close. The desserts are ginormous, so sharing is best."

Well, that's exactly what happened and we're all richer for it.Joining trailblazer Thai Elephant and relative newcomers Viet Kitchen and Thai Basil in Downtown's Asian hot spot is Thai'd Up, an unsuspecting joint residing in the Central/Adams retail space formerly occupied by yawner eateries Cafe Roma and the gone-in-60-seconds CityScapes.Thai'd Up exorcises the ghosts of crappy restaurants past and churns out some flavorful food at a decent price point.Thumbs Down: Service was sluggish; starter soup was cold; Level 4 spice (1-5) tasted more like Level 2; music was awful, maybe even intentionally so.Thumbs Up: The entree soup (coconut) was some of the best I've ever had;  egg roll was crisp and fresh; drunken noodles came out piping hot and were tasty; portions were generous; my colleague picked up the check.I'm eager to go back to try the vegetable spring rolls, Thai eggplant, and sweet and sour noodles.I also like that the dinner menu at Thai'd Up is different than the lunch menu, a rare and encouraging thing in Downtown Phoenix."

ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323a8d),"Oh Yucky Tap, I hardly know ye!Checked out the new expansion last night and I have to say I'm quite impressed. They took over some greasy food joint next door and instead of knocking out a wall and openin' 'er up, they simply added two entrances from the existing Yucca bar you know and love (ahem, some of us know and love quite a bit more than others).So the first entrance is right off the OG entrance, and the second entrance is punched out of the wood paneling wall where the booths stop on that side. Kinda funny since you won't notice it until someone comes through it, and the glowing white light and shiny floor pulls you in like siren song. However, the cuteness of the hidden door quickly wears off if you happen to be there on a packed night, because it's placement causes a TON of traffic jams and pushing and shoving as people try to go back/forth from expansion to OG bar, and try to make their way from back/front of OG bar, and people trying to watch the band get sick of shuffling around the disaster. They need a light or a stop sign or something, it was just a mess!But what about the fucking expansion already, right? No complaints there, not a one. I followed that soft glowing light, past three pool tables, two sparkly new (single person) bathrooms and to the bar, I was lead to a refrigerated cooler of ""craft"" beers. Beers in there range from $4 - $9. On tap, they had about 8 beers that included SKA True Blonde, Framboise, etc. I got the SKA and it was $4.25The service was fast and friendly and I was pretty happy to belly up there and wait for my friends. That's when someone sat down next to me and ordered ""two slices of pizza, with pineapple and olives."" Um, what? You can order FOOD here? You sure can, my dear bar flys. They have a full kitchen that churns out slices, calzones and sandwiches. Whoa! If you were trying to give Taste of Tops a run, you certainly beat them in the food department. OK, I'm gonna wrap this up since I have a problem with brevity:Awesome: Custom wall paper with Yucca's signature guitar logo, records and such; local artist paintings for sale and just for looking at; god, those nice new bathrooms need another mention!Oh! One last thing. A little birdie told me that the craft bar does not factor into the pay out to the bands that play in the OG bar. Something to consider when you come *specifically to see a cool band for no cover.* They make money off a percent of the bar bill (in this case, the OG bar bill only), so keep that in mind."

ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324925),"This is a tough one for me because it is already getting so popular.  Matt did a great job with this place.  It is a converted old (I'm guessing 30's) red brick home in downtown Phoenix.  The atmosphere is very warm, hip and comfortable but it can get a little cramped at times.  There is no jukebox but the music that fills the place is always solid with a good mix of some of the better trendy tunes from recent years.  I do like to partake in a finely crafted beer on occasion and they have a great selection of tap and bottled beer that you won't find at most places (try the Rogue Hazelnut Brown and their house beer made at Four Peaks Brewery).  Although I do enjoy wine as well I have not been able to pry myself away from the tap long enough to try any here.  That said I have noticed their selection looks well rounded and I have heard many good things about it.   The food menu is very simple but done very well.  Any place that serves a Dagwood is going to score points with me.  If I have to list any negatives it would be that the music can be a little loud at times and of course it can be a little cramped as well.  Overall I love this place and fear it becoming too popular but it is worth checking out."
