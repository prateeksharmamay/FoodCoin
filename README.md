# Project Abstract:

Problem Statement:<br /><br />
Huge amount of food is wasted in restaurants. The wastage is caused because of the following reasons:<br /><br />
1) Improper use of Inventory<br />
2) Incorrect estimation of customers<br />
3) Inappropriate utilization of prepared food<br />
4) Food Items not as per expectations of consumers.<br /><br />
Such wastage results in extra cost to the restaurants and inefficient estimates while preparing food or managing inventory make these restaurants spend extra money and resources.<br />
Moreover, the food items that are wasted could have been used to facilitate someone in need.<br /><br />
Proposed Solution:<br /><br />
To overcome such problem, we are planning to build an application that uses TensorFlow, a machine learning software, to find the pattern in the daily activities of restaurants. Further, we will create a Dashboard for the Manager that will show the current scenario of restaurant to him and suggest ways to how the wastage of resources can be minimized.<br /><br />
Benefits of analytics include:<br /><br />
1) Efficient use of raw materials:<br />
    a) Manager would be able to purchase inventory wisely.<br />
    b) Rotation of items in the inventory will lead in better utilization.<br />
2) Using fresh menu items:<br />
    a) Better assistance to Chef to decide daily menu by making him more aware about the inventory and customers’ count.<br />
3) Ensuring quality of food:<br />
    a) Help the manager to know about the factors to ensure better food quality.<br />
4) Assist in meeting diner’s expectation:<br />
    a) Help management to decide the quantity of food item to be served to user.<br />
    b) Assist in predicting the likes and dislikes of users.<br />
